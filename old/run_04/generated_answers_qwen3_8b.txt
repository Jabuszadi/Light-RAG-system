Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. First, I need to scan through the context information to find any mentions of Sam Altman.

Looking at the documents, the main content is about various AI models like GPT, Mistral, and others. There's a lot of technical details about their parameters, VRAM requirements, licenses, and applications. However, I don't see any mention of Sam Altman in the text. The documents discuss model versions, their features, and companies like OpenAI and Mistral AI, but no reference to Sam Altman. 

The user's instructions are clear: if the information isn't in the provided context, I must state that I can't find the answer. Since there's no mention of Sam Altman in any of the given fragments, the correct response is to inform the user that the information isn't available in the provided documents. I should avoid adding any external knowledge here. So the answer should be the specified apology message.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to answer the question: "Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?" based on the provided context. Let me go through the context carefully.

First, the context has several sections under the "Rodzina modeli LLaMA – przegląd i wymagania sprzętowe (stan na sierpień 2025 r.)" header. There's a summary table listing different generations and models. The table includes LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2-Vision, 4 Scout, 4 Maverick, and Code Llama. Each entry has details like parameters, context window, VRAM requirements, licenses, and use cases.

Looking at the sections for each model:
- LLaMA 1 has 7B, 13B, 65B.
- LLaMA 2 has 7B, 13B, 70B.
- Code Llama includes 7B, 13B, 30B/34B.
- LLaMA 3 has 8B and 70B.
- LLaMA 3.1 adds 8B, 70B, 405B.
- LLaMA 3.2 includes 1B, 3B, and Vision variants (11B, 90B).
- LLaMA 4 Scout is 17B active/109B total (MoE).
- LLaMA 4 Maverick is 17B active/400B total.

Each of these models is mentioned in the context with their respective details. The user is asking for a list of available models, so I need to extract all the model names and their variants as listed in the context. I should make sure not to include any models that aren't explicitly mentioned. For example, the Code Llama variants are part of the LLaMA family, so they should be included. Also, the 3.2-Vision models are separate but part of the LLaMA family. The 4 Scout and 4 Maverick are part of LLaMA 4. 

I need to list each model generation and their variants as per the context. The answer should be structured, mentioning each model and their available sizes. I must ensure that all names are correctly spelled and that the variants are included. Also, check if any models are mentioned in the sections under the headers, like the LLaMA 3.2-Vision. The context does mention these, so they should be included. 

I should avoid any prior knowledge and strictly use the context. For example, the context mentions "LLaMA 3.2-Vision (11 B/90 B)" so that's a separate model. Similarly, the 4 Scout and 4 Maverick are part of LLaMA 4. 

So, compiling all the models from the context: LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2-Vision, 4 Scout, 4 Maverick, and Code Llama. Each with their respective sizes. The answer should list each model and the sizes available, as per the context.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections of the PLLuM document. Under the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM is a consortium project of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by the Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, IP PAN, Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji PIB, University of Łódź, and Institute of Slavistics PAN. That definitely points to the creators.

Additionally, in the "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section, it's stated that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization on February 24, 2025, and developed by the aforementioned institutions. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" (Advantages and Features) section also mentions the Polish language model developed by the consortium of Polish institutions. 

I don't see any other sections that mention different creators, so the answer should be the consortium of those universities and institutes coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. The key points are all in the background and motivation section, so I need to reference that part to ensure the answer is fully supported by the context.
</think>

Odpowiedź: PLLuM został stworzony przez konsorcjum polskich uczelni i instytutów, w tym Politechnikę Wrocławską, NASK PIB, Instytut Podstaw Informatyki PAN, Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji PIB, Uniwersytet Łódzki oraz Instytut Slawistyki PAN. Informacja ta jest zawarta w sekcji „Tło i motywacja”, gdzie podano, że projekt został zaprezentowany przez Ministerstwo Cyfryzacji i opracowany przez wymienione instytucje.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. I need to look through the provided context to find models that fit this VRAM requirement.

First, I'll check the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB, which is way over 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x22B needs 300 GB, so that's too much. The Codestral 22B is 60 GB, which is also too high. The Codestral Mamba 7B is 16 GB, same as Mistral 7B. Mathstral 7B is also 16 GB. Mistral NeMo 12B is 28 GB in bf16, which is over 24. Pixtral 12B is 28 GB as well. Mistral Small 24B variants are 60 GB, so no. Ministral 8B is 24 GB, which matches exactly. Ministral 3B is 8 GB. Mistral Large 2 is 250 GB. Pixtral Large is 250 GB. So the Ministrals 8B and 3B are within the 24 GB range. 

Looking at the LLaMA models, the LLaMA 3.2 (3B) requires 3B: 6.5 GB (FP16), 3.2 GB (FP8), 1.75 GB (INT4). The LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B needs 10 GB VRAM in INT4. The LLaMA 3.1 8B requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16. The LLaMA 3.1 70B is 140 GB, which is too much. The LLaMA 3.1 405B is even higher. The LLaMA 3.2 1B and 3B are within the 24 GB range. 

The GPT models: GPT-3.5 Turbo is 16k tokens, but VRAM requirements are similar to GPT-3, which is 350 GB. GPT-4 Turbo is 128k tokens but requires 128 GB. GPT-OSS 120B is 80 GB, which is over 24. GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB, which fits. 

So, the models that fit 24 GB VRAM are Mistral 7B (16 GB), Codestral Mamba 7B (16 GB), Mathstral 7B (16 GB), Ministrals 8B (24 GB), Ministrals 3B (8 GB), LLaMA 3.2 3B (FP16 6.5 GB, FP8 3.2 GB, INT4 1.75 GB), LLaMA 3.2 1B (FP16 2.5 GB, FP8 1.25 GB, INT4 0.75 GB), and GPT-OSS 20B (16 GB). 

But the user is asking for the best model. The Mistral 7B, Codestral Mamba 7B, and Mathstral 7B all have 16 GB VRAM. The Ministrals 8B is exactly 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B and Codestral Mamba 7B are more powerful than the Ministrals 3B. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is also a good option but lower in parameters. The GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB but has 21B parameters, which is more than Mistral 7B's 7.3B. 

Wait, the GPT-OSS 20B is 21B parameters, which is more than Mistral 7B's 7.3B. But the VRAM requirement for GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB. So that's a better model in terms of parameters. However, the user might prefer the Mistral 7B for its specific applications like RAG. 

But the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (works best) on 24 GB VRAM. The Ministrals 8B is exactly 24 GB, but the GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB and has more parameters. However, the Mistral 7B is 16 GB and has 7.3B parameters. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is 3B parameters. 

The best model would be the one with the highest parameters that fits within 24 GB. The GPT-OSS 20B is 21B parameters, which is higher than Mistral 7B's 7.3B. However, the GPT-OSS 20B is part of the GPT-OSS series, which is open-source. But the user might prefer Mistral models if they are available. 

Wait, the GPT-OSS 20B is 21B parameters, which is a lot. But the VRAM required is 16 GB, which is under 24. So it's a better fit. However, the Mistral 7B is 7.3B parameters. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is 3B. 

So the GPT-OSS 20B is the best in terms of parameters, but the user might not have mentioned it. However, the context includes GPT-OSS 20B with 16 GB VRAM. Therefore, the answer should include the GPT-OSS 20B and Mistral 7B, etc. 

But the user's answer needs to be based on the context. The context mentions Mistral 7B, Codestral Mamba 7B, Mathstral 7B, Ministrals 8B, and GPT-OSS 20B. The Ministrals 8B requires 24 GB, which is exactly the VRAM available. The GPT-OSS 20B requires 16 GB, which is under. The Mistral 7B is 16 GB. So the best model would be the one with the highest parameters that fits. The GPT-OSS 20B (21B) is higher than Mistral 7B (7.3B). So the GPT-OSS 20B is better. However, the user might prefer Mistral models. 

But the context doesn't mention GPT-OSS 20B in the initial sections. Wait, looking back, in the GPT.txt, there's a section about GPT-OSS models. The GPT-OSS 20B is mentioned with 16 GB VRAM. So that's a valid model. 

Therefore, the answer should list the models that fit 24 GB VRAM: Ministrals 8B (24 GB), Mistral 7B (16 GB), Codestral Mamba 7B (16 GB), Mathstral 7B (16 GB), GPT-OSS 20B (16 GB), and LLaMA 3.2 3B (various options). But the user is asking for the best, so the Ministrals 8B is exactly 24 GB, which might be the best fit. However, the GPT-OSS 20B has more parameters. 

But the user's answer must be based on the context. The context says that Ministrals 8B is 24 GB, which is the exact VRAM. The GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB, which is under. So the Ministrals 8B is the best fit for 24 GB. The GPT-OSS 20B is also a good option but uses less VRAM. So the answer should mention both. However, the user might be looking for the one that uses exactly 24 GB. 

The answer should include the Ministrals 8B and GPT-OSS 20B as the best models for 24 GB VRAM. But the question is which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The Ministrals 8B is designed for on-device use with 24 GB, which is the exact VRAM. The GPT-OSS 20B is also a good option but uses less. 

So the answer should state that the Ministrals 8B is the best for 24 GB VRAM, as it's designed for that exact requirement. Also, the GPT-OSS 20B is another option with 16 GB VRAM. But the user's VRAM is 24 GB, so the Ministrals 8B is the best fit.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Model **Ministral 8B** najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM. W kontekście podano, że wymaga on **24 GB VRAM** (licencja Mistral Commercial/Research License), co dokładnie odpowiada dostępnej pamięci. Dodatkowo, model **GPT-OSS 20B** również jest kompatybilny z 24 GB VRAM, ponieważ jego wymagania są niższe (16 GB VRAM w INT4), ale jego wersja 20B ma 21 mld parametrów, co czyni go bardziej potężnym niż np. Mistral 7B (7,3 mld parametrów). Jednak Ministrals 8B jest optymalnie zaprojektowany do pracy na 24 GB VRAM, co sprawia, że jest najlepszym wyborem dla tego sprzętu.  

**Opierając się na fragmentach dokumentów:**  
- **Ministral 8B**: "Ministral 8B | 8 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 24 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License | niskolatencyjne asystenty on-device"  
- **GPT-OSS 20B**: "gpt-oss-20b: 21 mld parametrów, 3,6 mld aktywnych [...] 16 GB VRAM (INT4)"  
- **Mistral 7B**: "Mistral 7B | 7.3 B | 8k tokens | 16 GB | Apache 2.0 | lokalne asystenty, RAG, podstawowe generowanie tekstu"  

Wszystkie te modele są dostępne w kontekście, ale Ministrals 8B jest najbardziej dopasowany do 24 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context to find all the models mentioned and their respective VRAM requirements. The context includes several models from different generations like LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, Code Llama, and PLLuM. Also, there's information about Mistral models, but the user specifically asked about LLMs, so maybe focus on the LLaMA family and others mentioned.

Looking at the LLaMA 1 section, the 7B model requires 12-13 GB VRAM in FP16, but with 4-bit quantization, it's around 6 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking for the smallest model. 

Then, in the LLaMA 2 section, the 7B model is mentioned with 6 GB VRAM in 4-bit quantization. But wait, there's also the Code Llama 7B model, which requires ~6 GB VRAM in Q4 quantization. 

Looking further, in the LLaMA 3.2 section, the 1B model is mentioned. The 1B model requires 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16, 1.25 GB in FP8, and 0.75 GB in INT4. That's even smaller. 

Also, in the Mistral models, the Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision, but with quantization, it's less. However, the user is asking about LLMs in general, not just LLaMA. But the question is about the smallest model, so the 1B model from LLaMA 3.2 seems smaller than the 7B models. 

Wait, the user might be referring to the smallest model in the entire context. Let me check all sections again. 

In the PLLuM section, there's a model called PLLuM-8B, but that's 8B parameters. The 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is smaller. Also, in the Mistral section, the Ministral 3B is mentioned with 8 GB VRAM in INT4. But the 1B model from LLaMA 3.2 would be the smallest. 

Wait, but the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of VRAM requirement. The 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 requires 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4, which is much less than the 6 GB for the 7B models. 

So the smallest model in terms of VRAM is the LLaMA 3.2 1B model, requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. But I need to confirm if that's the case. Let me check again. 

In the LLaMA 3.2 section, the 1B model is mentioned with 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16, 1.25 GB in FP8, and 0.75 GB in INT4. The 3B model is 3.2 GB in FP16, etc. So the 1B model in INT4 is the smallest. 

Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2 1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. But wait, the user asked for the smallest model. The 1B model is smaller than the 3B, 7B, etc. So that's the correct answer. 

I need to make sure there's no smaller model mentioned. For example, in the PLLuM section, there's a model with 8B parameters, which is larger than 1B. The Mistral 3B model requires 8 GB VRAM in INT4, which is more than the 0.75 GB for the 1B model. 

Yes, the LLaMA 3.2 1B model is the smallest. The context mentions it in the LLaMA 3.2 section. So the answer is 0.75 GB VRAM for the LLaMA 3.2 1B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najmniejszy model LLM to **LLaMA 3.2 1B** (1 bilion parametrów), który wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** przy kwantyzacji INT4.  

**Podstawy:**  
- W sekcji dotyczącej **LLaMA 3.2** (wrzesień 2024) podano, że model 1B wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM (INT4)** (źródło: https://huggingface.co/blog/llama32#:~:text=Llama%203,Language%20Models).  
- Brak mniejszych modeli w kontekście (np. 7B, 13B, 30B itd.) wymagających mniej niż 0,75 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check all the given documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the context, most of it talks about different AI models like Mistral, GPT, LLaMA, and PLLuM. There's information about their features, licenses, and technical specs. But I'm skimming through each section again to make sure. 

Wait, in the GPT section, there's a mention of OpenAI and their models. The GPT-4 and GPT-4o entries talk about OpenAI's developments. But Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, right? However, the context here doesn't explicitly mention Sam Altman's name. The documents refer to OpenAI and their models but don't specify the individuals involved. 

The user's query is about Sam Altman, but none of the provided fragments mention his name. The context talks about companies and models but not the people behind them. So, based on the given information, there's no mention of Sam Altman. Therefore, the correct response should be that the answer isn't found in the provided documents.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which LLaMA models are available, based solely on the provided context. First, I need to go through all the context snippets to extract the relevant information.

Looking at the sections for each LLaMA version: LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2-Vision, 4 Scout, 4 Maverick. Each of these sections lists the available models. For example, LLaMA 1 has 7B, 13B, 65B. LLaMA 2 adds 7B, 13B, 70B. LLaMA 3 includes 8B and 70B. Then there's LLaMA 3.1 with 8B, 70B, 405B. LLaMA 3.2 has 1B, 3B, and Vision variants. The 4 series includes Scout (17B active, 109B total) and Maverick (17B active, 400B total). 

I need to make sure I include all these models and their parameters. Also, check if there are any other models mentioned, like Code Llama or PLLuM, but the user specifically asked about LLaMA models. PLLuM is a separate Polish model, so maybe exclude that unless it's part of LLaMA. Wait, the context mentions PLLuM in a separate file, so probably not part of the LLaMA family. 

Each model's parameters and variants should be listed. For example, LLaMA 3.2 has text-only and Vision models. The 4 series has different configurations with MoE. Also, note the VRAM requirements if necessary, but the user's question is just about availability, so maybe focus on the model names and parameters. 

Need to structure the answer clearly, listing each version and their respective models. Make sure not to add any external info. Check the context again to confirm all models are included. Alright, that's all the models mentioned in the context. Now, present them in a clear, concise manner without using markdown.

Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the "Tło i motywacja" section. The first paragraph mentions that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, IP PAN, etc. That seems like the main info. 

I should check if there are other mentions. In the "Podsumowanie" section, it again states that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish institutions, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. The same name appears in other sections, so it's consistent. 

No other entities are mentioned as creators. The context doesn't mention any individual creators, just the consortium and the coordinating university. So the answer should be the consortium of Polish universities and institutes coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. I need to make sure not to include any external info not in the context. The answer is there, so I can confirm it.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find relevant information about VRAM requirements for different models. The context mentions several models and their VRAM needs. 

Looking at the LLaMA series, the LLaMA 3.2-2B model is mentioned. It states that the 3B version requires 6.5 GB VRAM in FP16, which is well within 24 GB. The 8B version of LLaMA 3 requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is also under 24 GB. However, the 70B model needs 140 GB VRAM, which is way over. 

Then there's Mistral's models. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM, which is under 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB VRAM, which is too much. The Mistral Small 24B requires 60 GB VRAM, which is also over. 

The PLLuM models: the 8B version needs around 4.9 GB in Q4_K_M, and the 12B version needs 7.6 GB in Q4_K_M. These are well under 24 GB. The 70B PLLuM would need 35 GB in INT4, which is still under 24 GB? Wait, no, 35 GB is more than 24. So the 70B is out. 

Wait, the PLLuM-8×7B (MoE) requires 22.5 GB in 4-bit quantization. That's close to 24 GB. The 24 GB VRAM might be sufficient for that, but it's a bit tight. 

So, the models that fit within 24 GB VRAM are LLaMA 3.2-3B (6.5 GB), LLaMA 3.2-8B (16 GB), Mistral 7B (16 GB), PLLuM-8B (4.9 GB), PLLuM-12B (7.6 GB), and PLLuM-8×7B (22.5 GB). 

But the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2-8B is recommended for RAG applications with good quality and low latency. Also, Mistral's models are noted for their efficiency. However, the PLLuM-8×7B (MoE) uses only 2-4 experts, which might be more efficient. 

But the user's question is about VRAM. The LLaMA 3.2-8B requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is under 24 GB. The Mistral 7B also needs 16 GB. The PLLuM-8×7B at 22.5 GB is very close. 

The answer should list all models that fit within 24 GB, but the user might be looking for the best performing one. The context says LLaMA 3.2-8B is recommended for RAG with good quality. So maybe that's the best choice. Alternatively, the Mistral 7B is also a strong candidate. 

But the context mentions that the LLaMA 3.2-8B is part of the LLaMA 3.2 series, which has a 128k context window. The Mistral 7B has a 8k context. So if the user needs a longer context, LLaMA 3.2-8B is better. 

Therefore, the answer should highlight LLaMA 3.2-8B as the best fit for 24 GB VRAM, given its performance and efficiency, based on the context.

Odpowiedź:  
Na GPU z 24 GB VRAM najlepiej działają modele **LLaMA 3.2-8B** i **Mistral 7B**, ponieważ ich wymagania sprzętowe są w granicach dostępnej pamięci.  

1. **LLaMA 3.2-8B** wymaga **16 GB VRAM (FP16)**, co jest znacznie poniżej 24 GB. Model ten jest zalecany do zastosowań RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) z dobrym poziomem jakości i niskimi opóźnieniami (zgodnie z sekcją „Wnioski i rekomendacje” oraz „LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)”).  
2. **Mistral 7B** wymaga **16 GB VRAM (FP16)**, co również mieści się w 24 GB. Model ten oferuje wysoką wydajność i jest opisany jako dobry wybór dla lokalnych asystentów (tabela Mistral).  

Dodatkowo, **PLLuM-8B** (z kwantyzacją Q4_K_M) wymaga **4,9 GB VRAM**, co pozwala na uruchomienie na mniejszych GPU, ale jego wydajność w kontekście RAG jest również wskazana.  

Modele o większych parametrach (np. **LLaMA 3.2-70B**, **Mixtral 8×7B**, **PLLuM-70B**) wymagają przekraczających 24 GB VRAM i nie są dopasowane do tego sprzętu.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find all mentions of LLM models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files discussing different models like LLaMA, PLLuM, and Mistral. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2 with 1B and 3B parameters. The VRAM requirements for the 3B model are listed as 6.5 GB in bf16/fp16, 3.2 GB in FP8, and 1.75 GB in INT4. The 1B model requires 2.5 GB (FP16), 1.25 GB (FP8), or 0.75 GB (INT4). 

Then, in the Mistral section, the Mistral 7B model is mentioned with a minimum VRAM of 16 GB. However, the PLLuM models include the Llama-PLLuM-8B, which has a VRAM requirement of around 4.7 GB in Q4_K_S. But wait, the user is asking for the smallest model. 

Comparing the models, the smallest in the context is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model. The 1B model's VRAM requirements are lower than the 3B model. The 1B model's minimum VRAM in INT4 is 0.75 GB, which is the lowest among the mentioned models. However, the context also mentions the Mistral 3B model with 8 GB VRAM, but that's higher than the 1B's 0.75 GB in INT4. 

Wait, but the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is 1B parameters, which is smaller than the 3B. However, the PLLuM-8B is 8B parameters, which is larger. So the smallest model would be the 1B. 

But I need to check if there's any model smaller than 1B. The context mentions the Mistral 3B and 7B, but no smaller than that. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest. However, in the context, there's also a mention of the LLaMA 3.2-3B model, which is larger than the 1B. 

So the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. But I need to confirm if that's the smallest. The context also mentions the Mistral 3B with 8 GB VRAM, which is larger. The PLLuM-8B is 8B parameters, which is larger. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest. 

Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model needing 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. But I need to check if there's any other model with even smaller parameters. The context doesn't mention any models smaller than 1B. So that's the correct answer.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Najmniejszy model LLM to **LLaMA 3.2-1B**, który wymaga **ok. 0,75 GB VRAM** w precyzji INT4. Informacja ta pochodzi z sekcji dotyczącej LLaMA 3.2, gdzie podano, że model 1B potrzebuje 0,75 GB VRAM w formacie INT4 (patrz: "model 1 B ... 0,75 GB (INT4)").

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check all the given documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the context, most of it is about PLLuM, LLaMA models, their specifications, use cases, licensing, and some technical details. There's a mention of Meta, Mistral, and other companies, but nothing about Sam Altman. The documents talk about PLLuM's development by Polish institutions, the LLaMA series by Meta, and various technical aspects like VRAM requirements and licensing terms. However, there's no reference to Sam Altman or any related information. 

Since the user specified that the answer must be based exclusively on the provided context and not prior knowledge, and there's no mention of Sam Altman in any of the documents, the correct response is to state that the information isn't found in the provided texts.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find mentions of LLaMa models. The context has several files, including 'llama.txt' and 'pllum.txt'. Let me focus on the 'llama.txt' since that's where LLaMa is discussed.

In the 'llama.txt' document, under the section about LLaMA 3, it mentions that the third generation includes models **8B** and **70B**. There's also a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in the context, but the user specifically asked about LLaMa models. Wait, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family, so I should check if there are other models mentioned.

Looking further, the 'pllum.txt' document talks about PLLuM models, which are based on LLaMA 3.1, Mistral Nemo, and Mixtral. But the user is asking about LLaMa models, not PLLuM. However, the context might have other mentions. 

In the 'llama.txt' section under "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)", it states that the third generation includes 8B and 70B models. Also, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in the context, but the user's question is about LLaMa models. Wait, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family, which includes different versions. 

Wait, the user's query is about LLaMa models. The context mentions LLaMA 3 with 8B and 70B variants. Additionally, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in the context, but I need to check if those are part of the available models. 

In the 'llama.txt' document, under the "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)" section, it's stated that the third generation includes 8B and 70B models. Also, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in the context. However, the user is asking about LLaMa models, so I should list the models explicitly mentioned. 

Wait, the 'llama.txt' document also mentions LLaMA 4 in the "Trendy rozwojowe" section, but that's a future model. The user's question is about currently available models. The context says that LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 are available, but the main models listed are 8B and 70B. 

Wait, the user's question is about LLaMa models. The context in 'llama.txt' under "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)" says that the third generation includes 8B and 70B. Also, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2. However, the user is asking about LLaMa models, so the answer should include 8B, 70B, and possibly 3.1 and 3.2 if they are part of the available models. 

But the context in 'llama.txt' under "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)" specifically lists 8B and 70B as the models available. The 3.1 and 3.2 might be versions of the models, but the user is asking about the models available. So the answer should list 8B and 70B as the available models. 

Additionally, in the 'pllum.txt' document, there's a mention of PLLuM models based on LLaMA 3.1, but that's part of the PLLuM project, not LLaMa models themselves. 

Therefore, the available LLaMa models are 8B and 70B, as per the 'llama.txt' document. The user's question is about LLaMa models, not PLLuM, so the answer should focus on those two.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections related to the background and motivation of PLLuM. In the "Tło i motywacja" section, there's a mention that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by organizations like NASK PIB, PAN, and others. The link provided also mentions that the model was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization. 

Additionally, in the "Dostępne modele PLLuM" section, there's a note about the Polish language model being co-developed by OPI PIB, which is part of the consortium. The exact sentence states, "The Polish language model PLLuM was co-developed by OPI PIB and is ready for use." 

So, combining these points, the creators are the consortium of Polish institutions listed, with specific mention of OPI PIB as a co-developer. I need to make sure not to include any external knowledge and only reference the context provided. The answer should include the consortium members and OPI PIB as specified.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find information about VRAM requirements for different models. Let me start by recalling the relevant sections.

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's mention of Llama 3 models. The 8B model can run on a GPU with 16GB VRAM, and the 70B requires much more, like 48GB or more. But the user's GPU has 24GB, which is between 16GB and 48GB. However, the 8B model's full precision (FP16) needs 16GB, which is within 24GB. But maybe with some optimizations, it could work.

Then there's the PLLuM models. The Llama-PLLuM-8B has a VRAM requirement of around 4.7GB to 16.1GB in FP16. The 8B model here would be feasible with 24GB. The PLLuM-12B has higher requirements, like 12GB for Mistral Nemo 12B, but the 8B version is more suitable.

In the Mistral section, the Mistral 7B requires 16GB VRAM. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100GB, which is way over 24GB. The Mistral Small 24B requires 60GB, which is also too much. However, the Ministral 3B only needs 8GB, which is under 24GB, but maybe the 8B version? Wait, looking at the Mistral table, the Ministral 8B requires 24GB VRAM. That's exactly matching the user's GPU. Also, the Mistral Small 24B needs 60GB, which is over. The Pixtral 12B needs 28GB in bf16, which is close but still over 24GB. The Mistral Large 2 needs 250GB, which is way too much.

So, the Ministral 8B model requires 24GB VRAM, which fits exactly. Also, the Llama 3 8B model can run on 16GB, but with 24GB, maybe it's possible. However, the user is asking for the best model. The Ministral 8B is specifically mentioned as needing 24GB, which matches the GPU's capacity. Additionally, the PLLuM-8B models have lower VRAM requirements, but the 8B version's full precision is 16.1GB, which is under 24GB. But the Ministral 8B is a better fit because it's designed for that VRAM size.

Wait, the user's GPU is 24GB. The Ministral 8B needs 24GB, so that's the exact match. The Llama 3 8B can run on 16GB, but maybe with some optimizations, but the Ministral 8B is explicitly designed for 24GB. Also, the Mistral Small 24B is 60GB, which is too much. So the best model for 24GB VRAM is the Ministral 8B. Also, the PLLuM-8B models are also candidates, but their VRAM requirements are lower. However, the Ministral 8B is the one that exactly matches the 24GB requirement. Therefore, the answer should be the Ministral 8B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najlepiej działający model na GPU z 24 GB VRAM to **Ministral 8B**, który wymaga dokładnie 24 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji (bf16/fp16), jak podano w sekcji dotyczącej modeli Mistral. Dodatkowo, **PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat)** oraz **Llama-3 8B** również są kompatybilne z 24 GB VRAM, ponieważ ich wymagania przekraczają 16 GB (np. 16,1 GB w pełnej precyzji), co pozwala na uruchomienie na takim sprzęcie. Modele o większych rozmiarach, takie jak Mistral Small 24B (60 GB VRAM) lub Pixtral 12B (28 GB VRAM w bf16), przekraczają dostępne zasoby.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's query step by step. The user is asking about the VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context. 

First, I need to identify which model is considered the smallest. Looking through the context, there are several models discussed: Llama-PLLuM-8B, PLLuM-12B, PLLuM-70B, and PLLuM-8×7B. The 8B models are likely the smallest since 8B refers to 8 billion parameters, which is less than 12B, 70B, and the 8×7B (which is a Mixture-of-Experts model with around 45B active parameters).

Next, I need to find the VRAM requirements for the 8B model. In the context, under the "Dostępne modele PLLuM" section, the Llama-PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat) is mentioned. The VRAM requirements are listed as approximately 4.7 GB for Q4_K_S quantization. Additionally, the note mentions that these sizes are for minimal VRAM needed to load the model in the specified precision. 

I should confirm there's no smaller model mentioned elsewhere. The context also references LLaMA 3 models, but the user specifically asked about PLLuM. The LLaMA 3 8B model's VRAM is mentioned as needing around 16 GB VRAM in full precision, but since the user is asking about the smallest PLLuM model, the 8B variant is the correct one. 

Therefore, the answer should state that the smallest PLLuM model is Llama-PLLuM-8B, requiring about 4.7 GB VRAM with Q4_K_S quantization. I need to ensure that the answer is strictly based on the provided context and doesn't include any external information.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najmniejszy model PLLuM to **Llama-PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat)**. Wymagana pamięć VRAM to **ok. 4,7 GB** przy kwantyzacji Q4_K_S, jak wynika z fragmentu:

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context information related to LLaMa. The context mentions LLaMA 3 and LLaMA 2. For LLaMA 3, the available models are 8B and 70B. The context also talks about LLaMA 2 having models 7B, 13B, and 70B. 

I should check if there are any other LLaMa versions mentioned. The context also references LLaMA 1, but the user is specifically asking about available models, and the context doesn't mention any current models beyond LLaMA 2 and 3. 

Wait, the context does mention LLaMA 3's 8B and 70B, and LLaMA 2's 7B, 13B, 70B. Also, the LLaMA 3's 70B requires specific VRAM, which is part of the context. 

I need to make sure not to include any models not mentioned. The context doesn't mention LLaMA 1 being available now, so I should focus on LLaMA 2 and 3. 

So the answer should list the models from LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3 as per the context. Also, include the VRAM requirements if specified. The user wants precise numbers from the context.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the PLLuM sections. In the "Zastosowania" section under PLLuM, there's a mention of "model Mixture-of-Experts 8×7B" and a link to Hugging Face. But that doesn't mention the creators. 

Looking at the "Zalety i wyróżniki" section, there's a link to a blog post by OPi (Opinio Polska) and the Polish government. The text says "PLLuM was officially presented on..." and mentions collaboration with OPi and PIB (Polish Institute of Public Administration). 

Another part in the same section references "The Polish language model, developed in collaboration with OPi and PIB, is aligned on human preferences and compliance with relevant legal regulations." This indicates that OPi and PIB are the creators. 

I should check if there are other mentions. The Hugging Face link for PLLuM-12B-instruct mentions CYFRAGOVPL, which might be an organization, but the context doesn't explicitly state they are the creators. The key points are the collaboration with OPi and PIB. 

No other sections mention PLLuM's creators. So the answer should be OPi and PIB based on the provided fragments.

Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. They want the answer strictly based on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find models that fit into a 24 GB VRAM setup. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the LLaMA models: The LLaMA 3.2-8B model requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. That's within 24 GB. Also, the LLaMA 3.2-11B model needs 10 GB VRAM in INT4. Wait, but the user's GPU has 24 GB. So maybe the 11B model in INT4 could work, but the context mentions that the 11B model needs ~10 GB VRAM in INT4. But the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is more than enough for that. However, the LLaMA 3.2-11B is part of the Vision models, which might have additional requirements. Wait, the context says the 11B Vision model needs ~10 GB VRAM in INT4. So that's possible.

Looking at Mistral models: The Mistral 7B model requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is under 24 GB. The Mistral Small 24B models require 60 GB VRAM, which is over 24 GB. The Ministral 8B model needs 24 GB VRAM in FP16. Wait, the context mentions Ministral 8B requires 24 GB VRAM (FP16) and 8 GB in FP8. So that's exactly matching the 24 GB VRAM. Also, the Mistral 3B model needs 8 GB VRAM, which is well within 24 GB. But the user is asking for the best model, so maybe the Ministral 8B is a candidate because it's designed for on-device use with lower latency. Also, the Mistral 7B is another option.

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2-8B model in FP16 requires 16 GB VRAM, which is under 24 GB. The Mistral 7B in FP16 is 16 GB, and the Ministral 8B in FP16 is 24 GB. So the Ministral 8B would use the full 24 GB, but maybe it's optimized for that. Also, the LLaMA 3.2-8B in FP8 would use 8 GB, leaving more VRAM for other tasks. However, the user is asking for the best model, which might depend on the specific use case. But the context mentions that Ministral 8B is recommended for low-latency on-device use. 

Another option is the LLaMA 3.2-3B model, which uses 8 GB VRAM in FP16. But the user might want a larger model. The Mistral 7B is also a strong candidate. However, the Ministral 8B is specifically mentioned to use 24 GB VRAM in FP16, which matches the user's GPU. Also, the context says that the Mistral 7B can run on 16 GB VRAM, which is under 24 GB, but the Ministral 8B is designed for 24 GB. 

Additionally, the Mistral Small 24B requires 60 GB, which is too much. The LLaMA 3.1 70B in INT4 needs 35 GB, which is more than 24. The LLaMA 3.1 8B in INT4 uses 4 GB, which is way under. 

So, considering all options, the Ministral 8B (FP16) requires exactly 24 GB VRAM, which fits perfectly. The Mistral 7B uses 16 GB, which is also possible, but the Ministral 8B is tailored for 24 GB. Also, the context mentions that Ministral 8B is for low-latency on-device use, which might be better for the user's needs. Therefore, the Ministral 8B is the best fit.

Odpowiedź:  
Model **Ministral 8B** najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM. W kontekście podano, że wymaga on 24 GB VRAM w precyzji FP16 (patrz: "Ministral 8B: 24 GB VRAM (FP16)..."). Dodatkowo, modele takie jak **LLaMA 3.2-8B** (w precyzji FP16: 16 GB VRAM) oraz **Mistral 7B** (16 GB VRAM w FP16) również działają w zasięgu 24 GB VRAM, ale Ministral 8B jest optymalnie dopasowany do tego rozmiaru pamięci, co zwiększa jego wydajność w zastosowaniach lokalnych (np. asystentów on-device).

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the minimum VRAM required to run the smallest LLM mentioned in the context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the provided context to find information about LLaMA models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files, but the relevant parts are in the 'llama.txt' file. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a table summarizing different models. The first entry is LLaMA 1 with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. The VRAM requirements for 7B are listed as ~12–13 GB VRAM (FP16) and 3–6 GB VRAM (4-bit). However, the user is asking for the smallest model. 

Further down, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 with 8B parameters. The VRAM for 8B in FP16 is ~16 GB, FP8 is 8 GB, and INT4 is 4 GB. But wait, there's also a section about LLaMA 3.2 with 1B and 3B models. The 1B model's VRAM is 2.5 GB (FP16), 1.25 GB (FP8), and 0.75 GB (INT4). 

Wait, the 1B model is smaller than the 8B. But I need to check if the 1B model is part of the LLaMA series. Looking back, the LLaMA 3.2 section mentions 1B and 3B models. However, the context also includes information about Mistral models. The user specifically asked about LLM, so focusing on LLaMA.

Wait, the user's question is about the smallest LLM in the context. The LLaMA 3.2-1B model is mentioned with VRAM requirements of 2.5 GB (FP16). But earlier, in the LLaMA 1 section, the 7B model requires 12-13 GB VRAM. However, the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is smaller. 

But wait, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is part of the LLaMA 3.2 series. The context also mentions LLaMA 3.2-1B and 3B models. The VRAM for 1B in FP16 is 2.5 GB. However, the user is asking for the smallest model. Is there a smaller model than 1B in the context? 

Looking at the Mistral models, the Mistral 7B is mentioned with 16 GB VRAM in FP16, but that's larger than the 1B LLaMA model. The Mistral 3B model requires 8 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking about LLM in general, not specifically LLaMA. Wait, the user's question is about the smallest LLM in the context, which includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. 

Wait, the user's first question is about the smallest LLM, so I need to compare all models mentioned in the context. The LLaMA 3.2-1B model requires 2.5 GB VRAM (FP16), while the Mistral 3B requires 8 GB VRAM. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest in terms of parameters and VRAM. 

But wait, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is part of the LLaMA series. The context also mentions the LLaMA 3.2-1B model with VRAM requirements. Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in the entire context, which could be the Mistral 3B or even smaller. 

Wait, looking back, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is 1B parameters, and the Mistral 3B is 3B parameters. So the LLaMA 3.2-1B is smaller. Also, the Mistral 3B requires 8 GB VRAM, which is higher than the LLaMA 3.2-1B's 2.5 GB. Therefore, the smallest model in terms of VRAM and parameters is the LLaMA 3.2-1B. 

But I need to check if there's any smaller model. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest in the context. The answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 2.5 GB VRAM (FP16). However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in the LLaMA series. Wait, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is part of the LLaMA series. The context mentions LLaMA 3.2-1B and 3B models. The 1B model is smaller than the 3B. 

Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model, requiring 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. The context mentions this under the LLaMA 3.2 section. The exact text is: "1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)". So the minimum VRAM for the smallest model is 0.75 GB in INT4, but the user is asking for the VRAM required to run the model. However, the question is about the "najmniejszy model llm", which translates to the smallest LLM. The smallest in terms of parameters is the 1B model. 

But the user might be referring to the smallest in terms of VRAM. However, the question is about the smallest model, which would be the one with the fewest parameters, which is the 1B model. The VRAM required for that model in INT4 is 0.75 GB. However, the question might be asking for the VRAM required to run it, which depends on the quantization. 

But the user's question is to find the smallest model (in terms of parameters) and the VRAM needed. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest model in the context with 1B parameters. The VRAM required for it in FP16 is 2.5 GB, but if quantized to INT4, it's 0.75 GB. However, the user might be asking for the VRAM required to run the model, which could be in FP16. 

Looking back at the context, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is mentioned with VRAM requirements: "1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)". The smallest model in terms of parameters is the 1B model. Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. However, the user might be referring to the minimum VRAM needed to run it, which would be the INT4 quantization. 

But the user's question is to find the smallest model and the VRAM needed. The answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. However, the context also mentions the Mistral 3B model requiring 8 GB VRAM, which is larger. 

Therefore, the correct answer is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model with 0.75 GB VRAM (INT4). However, the user might be asking for the VRAM in FP16. The context states that the 1B model requires 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. But the question is about the smallest model, which would be the one with the fewest parameters. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is part of the LLaMA 3.2 series, which has 1B and 3B models. The 1B is the smallest in the context. Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM (INT4). However, the user might be asking for the VRAM in FP16. 

But the question is about the smallest model, which is the 1B model. The VRAM required depends on the quantization. The context mentions that the 1B model requires 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM (INT4). 

However, I need to check if there's a smaller model in the context. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest mentioned. The Mistral 7B is larger. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest. Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model with 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if I'm an AI assistant that can only answer questions using the provided context. The query is about Sam Altman, and I need to check if any of the given documents mention him.

First, I'll go through each of the context snippets. The PLLuM documents talk about the model itself, its applications, training data, and collaborations. The Mistral AI documents mention various models and their features but don't reference Sam Altman. The GPT models section discusses OpenAI's GPT series, but there's no mention of Sam Altman here either. 

Looking through all the provided text, I don't see any mention of Sam Altman. The documents discuss PLLuM, Mistral AI models, and GPT models, but none of them reference Sam Altman. Therefore, the answer should state that the information isn't found in the provided context.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find mentions of LLaMA models. The relevant section seems to be the one from the "llama.txt" file. 

Looking at the context, there's a section titled "LLaMA 3.2 (September 2024)" which mentions the addition of lightweight models 1B and 3B, along with multimodal variants like Llama 3.2-Vision 11B and 90B. Also, the LLaMA 3.1 is referenced, and there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2 and 4 with additional restrictions in the EU for the Vision variants.

Another part of the context from the same file talks about the LLaMA 3.2 and 4 introducing more constraints regarding image processing in the EU. The LLaMA 3.1 is mentioned as part of the family, and the 3.2 version includes the 1B and 3B models. The 90B is also noted as a multimodal variant. 

Wait, the user is asking about available models. The context lists LLaMA 3.1, 3.2 (with 1B, 3B, Vision 11B, 90B), and mentions LLaMA 4, but the details for 4 are only about the EU restrictions. The 3.2 section also refers to the 1B and 3B as part of the LLaMA 3.2 family. 

So compiling this, the available models according to the context are LLaMA 3.1, LLaMA 3.2 (including 1B, 3B, Vision 11B, 90B), and LLaMA 4. However, the 4 is mentioned with restrictions but no specific models beyond that. The user might need to know the exact models listed. 

Wait, the context says LLaMA 3.2 includes 1B and 3B text models and Vision variants. The 90B is part of the Vision models. Also, the original LLaMA 1 and 3.1 are part of the family, but the user's question is about available models, so the answer should list all the models mentioned in the context. 

So the answer should include LLaMA 3.1, 3.2 (with 1B, 3B, Vision 11B, 90B), and LLaMA 4. But need to check if the context explicitly states these as available. The 3.2 section mentions the 1B and 3B as part of the 3.2 family, and the 90B as a Vision variant. The 4 is mentioned but without specific models beyond the EU restrictions. 

Therefore, the answer should list LLaMA 3.1, 3.2 (including 1B, 3B, Vision 11B, 90B), and LLaMA 4. But the user might be looking for the models available as per the context. The context also mentions that LLaMA 3.2 and 4 have additional restrictions, but the models themselves are available. 

So the final answer includes LLaMA 3.1, 3.2 (with the specified variants), and LLaMA 4. Need to make sure each model is mentioned with the details from the context.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections about PLLuM. In the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization on February 24, 2025. The text also states that it was developed by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by the Wrocław University of Technology and supported by NASK PIB, the Institute of Fundamentals of Informatics PAN, the PIB Information Processing Center, the Łódź University, and the PAN Slavic Studies Institute. 

Another part in the "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section confirms that the model was co-created by OPI PIB, which is part of the consortium. The URL provided in the context also references articles mentioning the collaboration between these institutions. 

So, the key points are the consortium of Polish academic institutions, led by Wrocław University of Technology, with support from the listed organizations. The answer should include these entities without referencing the context directly, as per the rules. I need to make sure not to mention any external knowledge and strictly use the context provided.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. They want the answer strictly based on the provided context.

First, I'll go through each document to find mentions of VRAM requirements. Starting with the PLLum.txt, it mentions that the 8B and 12B models are more consumer-friendly, but the exact VRAM numbers aren't specified here. The Mistral models in mistal.txt have some details. The Mistral 7B can run on 12 GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization, and the bf16 version needs 16 GB. The Mistral Large 2 requires 233 GB in full precision but can be reduced to 58 GB with int4. 

Looking at the LLaMA section in llama.txt, the 7B model needs 12-13 GB in FP16, and the 13B version requires 24 GB in full precision. The 65B is way beyond 24 GB. The GPT section doesn't mention specific VRAM numbers, so maybe not relevant here.

The user's GPU has 24 GB VRAM. The Mistral Large 2's int4 version needs 58 GB, which is more than 24. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Mistral Large 2's full precision is 233 GB, but with int4 it's 58 GB. Wait, 58 GB is still more than 24. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check again. 

Wait, in the Mistral Large 2 entry, it says that with int4 quantization, the VRAM requirement is reduced to ~58 GB. Wait, that's still higher than 24 GB. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the user's GPU is 24 GB. So the Mistral 7B with 4-bit quantization can run on 4 GB VRAM, but that's for the 7B model. The Mistral Large 2's int4 version needs 58 GB, which is more than 24. 

Wait, looking back, the Mistral 7B can be run on 4 GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization. But the user's GPU is 24 GB. So maybe the Mistral 7B in full precision (16 GB VRAM) would work. Also, the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs 24 GB VRAM. So both the LLaMA 13B and Mistral 7B in full precision would require 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B's full precision is 16 GB, but maybe the user's 24 GB is sufficient. 

Wait, the LLaMA 13B in full precision requires ~24 GB VRAM. The Mistral 7B in full precision (bf16) needs 16 GB. So both models can run on 24 GB. But which one is better? The user might prefer the Mistral 7B because it's more efficient. Also, the Mistral 7B's 4-bit version can run on 4 GB, but that's not relevant here. 

Alternatively, the PLLum 12B model might be a candidate. Wait, the PLLum 12B's VRAM requirement isn't specified, but the Mistral 7B's full precision is 16 GB, which is under 24. The LLaMA 13B requires 24 GB. So both models can fit into 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B is mentioned as a base model with good performance. Also, the Mistral Large 2's int4 version is 58 GB, which is over 24. 

So the answer should be Mistral 7B or LLaMA 13B. But the user's query is about which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The Mistral 7B is mentioned as a starting point for other models and has lower VRAM requirements. However, the LLaMA 13B requires exactly 24 GB. The Mistral 7B in full precision (bf16) needs 16 GB, which is under 24. So both models can run, but the Mistral 7B might be better due to lower VRAM usage and efficiency. 

Wait, but the user's GPU is 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B requires 24 GB in full precision. The Mistral 7B can run on 16 GB. So the Mistral 7B would have more available VRAM for other tasks. But the question is which model works best. Maybe the answer is Mistral 7B because it's more efficient and can use the 24 GB VRAM effectively. Alternatively, the LLaMA 13B is also a possibility. 

Looking back at the context, the Mistral 7B's full precision needs 16 GB, which is under 24. The LLaMA 13B requires 24 GB. Both can run, but the Mistral 7B is more efficient. Therefore, the answer should be Mistral 7B.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Model **Mistral 7B** najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM. Wersja pełnej precyzji (bf16) wymaga ok. 16 GB VRAM, co umożliwia wykorzystanie dostępnych 24 GB. Dodatkowo, Mistral 7B jest wersją podstawową, która jest efektywniejsza w wykorzystaniu zasobów i służy jako punkt wyjściowy dla innych modeli Mistral. Modele o większych rozmiarach, takie jak LLaMA 13B (wymagające 24 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji) lub Mistral Large 2 (z wymaganiami powyżej 24 GB), są mniej optymalne w tym przypadku.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find mentions of the smallest model. The context includes several files, like pllum.txt, mistal.txt, and llama.txt. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the "llama.txt" document under the LLaMA 1 section, it mentions LLaMA 1 variants: 7B, 13B, and 65B. The 7B model is the smallest here. The text states that the 7B model in FP16 requires about 12-13 GB VRAM. However, there's also a note about quantized versions (like 8-bit or 4-bit) that can run on GPUs with 6 GB VRAM. But the question is about the smallest model, so the 7B is the candidate.

Wait, but in the "mistal.txt" document, there's a mention of Ministral 3B and 8B models. The 3B model is smaller than the 7B LLaMA. The context says Ministral 3B requires a minimum of 8 GB VRAM. That's even smaller than the 7B LLaMA. 

But the user specifically asked about the "smallest model llm". The context mentions both LLaMA and Mistral models. The Ministral 3B is 3B parameters, which is smaller than LLaMA's 7B. So the smallest model in the context is Ministral 3B, requiring 8 GB VRAM. 

However, I need to confirm if there's any model smaller than 3B. Checking other sections, the PLLuM models start at 8B, so they're larger. The Mistral series includes 3B and 8B, so 3B is the smallest mentioned. 

Therefore, the answer should be Ministral 3B requiring 8 GB VRAM. The relevant context is from the "mistal.txt" section under "Ministral 3B i 8B" where it states the minimum VRAM is 8 GB for the 3B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Najmniejszy model LLM to **Ministral 3B**, który wymaga **8 GB VRAM**.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- W dokumencie `mistal.txt` podano, że modele Ministral 3B i 8B są dostępne w licencji Mistral Commercial/Research, a ich minimalne wymagania VRAM to **8 GB dla 3B** i **24 GB dla 8B** (patrz sekcja „Ministral 3B i 8B”).
