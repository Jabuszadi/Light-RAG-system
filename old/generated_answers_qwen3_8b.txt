Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. First, I need to scan through all the given documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking at the context, the main topics are about various AI models like GPT, Mistral, and others. There's detailed information on their parameters, licenses, use cases, and technical specs. However, I don't see any mention of Sam Altman in any of the provided texts. The documents discuss model versions, licensing details, hardware requirements, and applications, but no personal information about individuals. 

Since the user specified that the answer must be based exclusively on the provided context and not prior knowledge, and there's no reference to Sam Altman in the documents, the correct response is to state that the information isn't found in the provided texts. I need to make sure not to include any external knowledge here. The answer should be precise and adhere strictly to the context given.

Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. First, I need to scan through all the context documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking at the files, the main topics are about various AI models like Mistral, GPT, LLaMA, and PLLuM. There's a lot of technical details about their parameters, licenses, and use cases. The GPT section mentions OpenAI and their models, but I need to check if Sam Altman is referenced there.

In the GPT document, under the "Ewolucja serii GPT" table, there's a mention of GPT-1, GPT-2, etc., but no name. Further down, in the section about GPT-4o, there's a link to a Wikipedia page for GPT-4, but again, no mention of Sam Altman. 

Looking at other documents, the Mistral AI info talks about their CEO or founders, but not Sam Altman. The LLaMA document mentions Meta and their models, but not Sam Altman. The PLLuM document is about a Polish model and its applications. 

Wait, in the GPT document, there's a mention of OpenAI and their models, but Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI. However, the context provided doesn't explicitly state that. The documents talk about the models and their features but don't mention any individuals beyond the companies. 

Since none of the provided context fragments mention Sam Altman, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the documents. The user's instructions say to respond with a specific message if the answer isn't in the context. So, the correct response is to apologize and state that the answer isn't in the provided documents.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if I'm an AI assistant whose only task is to answer questions using exclusively the provided context. The query then asks specifically about Sam Altman, and I need to check if the context mentions him.

First, I'll scan through the provided context documents. The main content is about PLLuM, LLaMA models, their applications, licensing, hardware requirements, etc. There's a mention of Meta and Llama models, but no reference to Sam Altman. The documents discuss PLLuM's development by Polish institutions, Mistral OCR, LLaMA versions, and technical specs. However, Sam Altman isn't mentioned anywhere. 

I need to make sure I didn't miss any part. Let me quickly check each section again. The Tło i motywacja section talks about PLLuM's consortium, including Politechnika Wrocławskia and other institutes, but no personal names. The LLaMA section mentions Meta's licensing but not Sam Altman. The Mistral OCR part is about the OCR model. The rest is about models, their parameters, VRAM requirements, and applications. 

Since there's no mention of Sam Altman in any of the provided fragments, the correct response is to state that the answer isn't found in the documents. The user emphasized using only the context and not prior knowledge, so even if I know who Sam Altman is, I can't include that here. The answer must strictly rely on the given text.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check all the documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the context, most of it talks about different AI models like LLaMA, Mistral, GPT, and PLLuM. There's information about their features, licenses, hardware requirements, and applications. But I'm skimming through each section quickly. 

Wait, in the GPT section, there's a mention of OpenAI and their models. Let me check that part again. The GPT-4 section mentions OpenAI and Microsoft's involvement. But Sam Altman is known for his role at OpenAI. However, the context here doesn't explicitly name him. The documents talk about OpenAI's models and their licensing, but not specifically about Sam Altman. 

Another place to check: the Mistral AI section. No mention of Sam Altman there. The PLLuM document is about a Polish model, so not relevant. The LLaMA documents discuss Meta's models. The OCR and other Mistral models also don't mention him. 

Since none of the provided context directly references Sam Altman, the answer should state that the information isn't found in the documents. The user emphasized using only the given context, so even if I know from prior knowledge that Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, I can't include that here. The correct response is to inform the user that the answer isn't in the provided texts.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if I'm an AI assistant that can only answer questions using the provided context. The main task is to answer who Sam Altman is, but I need to check the given context first.

Looking through the context information, there are several files mentioning PLLuM, Mistral models, and GPT models. The PLLuM documentation talks about its development by Polish institutions, applications in public administration, and technical details like training data and fine-tuning. The Mistral AI section mentions models like Codestral Embed, Mixtral, and others, but no mention of Sam Altman. The GPT models section discusses OpenAI's GPT series, but again, no reference to Sam Altman. 

Wait, Sam Altman is a well-known figure in AI, co-founder of OpenAI, but the context provided here doesn't mention him. All the documents are about PLLuM, Mistral models, and GPT models' technical specs, use cases, and licensing. There's no information about Sam Altman in any of the provided fragments. 

Since the user instructed to only use the given context and not prior knowledge, and since none of the provided documents mention Sam Altman, the correct response is to state that the answer isn't found in the context. I need to make sure not to add any external information here. The answer should be the exact phrase specified in rule 4.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context information given.

Looking at the table in the "Podsumowanie tabelaryczne" section, there's a list of models from LLaMA 1 to LLaMA 4, including various versions like 3.1, 3.2, and 3.2-Vision. Each entry has details like parameters, context window, VRAM requirements, licenses, and use cases. 

Then, in the "Wnioski i rekomendacje" section, they mention LLaMA 4 variants like Scout and Maverick with specific parameters. The "Wprowadzenie" section also lists LLaMA 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

I should make sure to list all the models mentioned. Let's see:

- LLaMA 1: 7B, 13B, 65B
- LLaMA 2: 7B, 13B, 70B
- Code Llama: 7B, 13B, 30B/34B
- LLaMA 3: 8B, 70B
- LLaMA 3.1: 8B, 70B, 405B
- LLaMA 3.2: 1B, 3B, 11B, 90B (Vision)
- LLaMA 4: Scout (17B active, 109B total), Maverick (17B active, 400B total)

Each of these is mentioned in the context, so I need to include them all. Also, check if there are any other models mentioned in the sections. The "LLaMA 2" section talks about Code Llama as a variant. The "LLaMA 3.2" section mentions Vision models. The "LLaMA 4" section has Scout and Maverick. 

I need to ensure that all these models are listed with their respective parameters and any additional info like VRAM or licenses, but the user's question is only about which models are available. However, the answer must be fully supported by the context. So, just list the model names and their variants as per the context. Make sure not to add any external info. Also, check for any other models mentioned in the sections. The answer should be precise, using exact names and parameters from the context.

Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which LLaMA models are available, based solely on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context information carefully.

Looking at the context, there are several sections discussing different versions of LLaMA. Starting with LLaMA 1, which had 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 added 7B, 13B, and 70B. LLaMA 3 introduced 8B and 70B, and later LLaMA 3.1 expanded to 8B, 70B, and 405B. LLaMA 3.2 includes 1B, 3B, and Vision variants like 11B and 90B. LLaMA 4 has Scout and Maverick with 17B active and up to 400B parameters. Also, there's mention of Code Llama with different parameter sizes.

I need to list all these models, making sure to include their parameter counts and any specific notes. The user wants the answer fully supported by the context, so I have to extract exact numbers and model names from the provided text. I should avoid adding any external information. Let me check each section again to ensure I don't miss any models. Also, note the VRAM requirements and licenses where mentioned, but the main focus is on the models available. Alright, compiling all the models with their respective details as per the context.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find mentions of LLaMa models. The context includes several files, but the relevant ones are llama.txt and pllum.txt. 

Looking at the llama.txt file, there's a section about LLaMA 3. It mentions that the third generation includes models with 8B and 70B parameters. The text also talks about the architecture, hardware requirements, and licensing. Specifically, it states: "Dostępne modele to **8 B** i **70 B**." So that's two models: 8B and 70B.

Additionally, in the pllum.txt file, there's a mention of Llama-PLLuM-8B and Llama-PLLuM-70B, which are based on Llama 3.1. However, the user is asking about LLaMa models in general, not PLLuM variants. But since the context does mention PLLuM being based on Llama 3.1, maybe that's part of the answer. Wait, the user's question is about LLaMa models, not PLLuM. So the PLLuM models are based on LLaMa but are separate models. The question is specifically about LLaMa, so the PLLuM models might not be included unless the context explicitly states they are part of LLaMa.

Wait, the context in pllum.txt says: "PLLuM‑8B (base/instruct/chat) | 8 mld parametrów, oparte na **Llama 3.1‑8B**" and "PLLuM‑70B (base/instruct/chat) | 70 mld parametrów; oparte na **Llama 3.1‑70B**". So PLLuM models are based on Llama 3.1, but they are separate models. The user is asking about LLaMa models, not PLLuM. Therefore, the answer should focus on the LLaMa models mentioned in the context, which are LLaMA 3's 8B and 70B.

In the llama.txt, the LLaMA 3 section explicitly lists 8B and 70B. Also, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in other parts. Wait, in the llama.txt under "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)", it says "Dostępne modele to **8 B** i **70 B**." So that's the 8B and 70B models. Also, in the same section, there's a mention of Llama 3.1 and 3.2, but the available models are 8B and 70B. 

Additionally, in the llama.txt under "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)", the architecture section mentions Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and a new tokenizer. The hardware requirements for Llama 3 70B require over 140 GB VRAM, and the 8B model needs at least 16 GB VRAM. 

So the answer should include the 8B and 70B models from LLaMA 3. Also, in the same context, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2, but the available models are 8B and 70B. The user is asking about LLaMa models, so the answer is LLaMA 3 with 8B and 70B parameters. The PLLuM models are based on LLaMa but are separate, so they might not be included unless specified. However, the user's question is about LLaMa models, so the answer should focus on those explicitly mentioned in the context.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Dostępne modele LLaMa to:  
1. **LLaMA 3** – modele z parametrami **8B** i **70B**.  
2. **LLaMA 3.1** – bazuje na architekturze z LLaMA 3, z ulepszonym tokenizerem i większym zbiorem danych (7 mld tokenów).  
3. **LLaMA 3.2** – dodatkowa wersja z ograniczeniami w UE, dostępna w formacie multimodalnym.  

Te informacje są oparte na fragmentach dokumentów, które wskazują na dostępność modeli 8B i 70B w trzeciej generacji LLaMA, a także na wersjach 3.1 i 3.2 z specyfikacją techniczną i licencją.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to answer the question: "Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?" which translates to "What LLaMa models are available?" based on the provided context. Let me go through the context information carefully.

First, looking at the LLaMA sections. In the LLaMA 3 section, it mentions that the third generation includes models 8B and 70B. Then, in the LLaMA 2 section, it states that LLaMA 2 offers 7B, 13B, and 70B models. The introduction to LLaMA also mentions that the first generation (LLaMA 1) was released in 2023, but the question is about available models, so I should focus on the ones explicitly listed.

Wait, the user is asking about available models, so I need to check which models are mentioned as being available. The LLaMA 3 section says "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B". The LLaMA 2 section lists 7B, 13B, and 70B. The introduction to LLaMA mentions that LLaMA 1 was released in 2023 as an experimental model, but the context doesn't specify if they are still available. However, the question is about available models, so perhaps LLaMA 1 isn't listed as available in the context provided. The LLaMA 3 and 2 sections are the ones that mention specific models.

Also, in the LLaMA 3 section, it's mentioned that the 70B model requires over 140GB VRAM in full precision, but that's about requirements, not availability. The key point is the models listed as available. So, combining the information from LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3, the available models are 7B, 13B, 8B, and 70B. Wait, LLaMA 2 has 7B, 13B, 70B. LLaMA 3 adds 8B and 70B. But the 70B is mentioned in both. So the available models are 7B, 13B, 8B, and 70B. However, I need to check if the context says they are available. The LLaMA 2 section says "komercyjnie dostępne modele 7 B, 13 B i 70 B". The LLaMA 3 section says "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B". So combining these, the available models are 7B, 13B, 8B, and 70B. But wait, the 70B is mentioned in both LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3. So the answer should list all these models. However, I need to make sure that the context explicitly states their availability. The LLaMA 2 section says they are commercially available, and LLaMA 3 mentions they are available. So the answer should include 7B, 13B, 8B, and 70B. Also, the LLaMA 3 section mentions the 70B model, so that's included. The user might be asking about the latest models, but the context includes both LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3. Therefore, the answer should list all the models mentioned as available in the context.

Looking at the context, there's a file named llama.txt that discusses the LLaMA family. In the "LLaMA 3.2 (September 2024)" section, it mentions the addition of 1B and 3B text models, as well as multimodal Vision variants like Llama 3.2-Vision 11B and 90B. The context also refers to previous generations, like LLaMA 3.1, but the specific models listed here are 1B, 3B, 11B, and 90B for the Vision variants. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the LLaMA 3.2 models have different VRAM requirements based on quantization, but the user is asking about available models, not the hardware specs. The answer should list the model names and sizes as per the context. The 1B and 3B are text models, and the Vision ones are multimodal. I need to make sure not to include any models not mentioned in the provided fragments. Since the user wants precise names and sizes, I'll extract those details directly from the context without adding any external information.

Then, in the "Zalety i wyróżniki" section, there's a line that says "PLLuM został oficjalnie zaprezentowany na wydarzeniach CYFRAGOVPL..." which translates to CYFRAGOVPL presenting PLLuM. 

Looking further, in the same section, there's a link to "huggingface.co/CYFRAGOVPL/PLLuM-12B-instruct" which suggests CYFRAGOVPL is involved. Another part mentions "współtwórzony przez OPiPib" which means co-developed by OPiPib. 

Wait, the user is asking who created PLLuM. The context mentions CYFRAGOVPL as the entity that presented it, and OPiPib as a co-developer. The answer should include both entities. Let me check again. 

In the "Zalety i wyróżniki" section, the third point mentions "Twórcy stosują licencjonowane treści i uwzględniają polskie przepisy o prawach autorskich, a także manualnie anotują preferencje..." which refers to the creators. Then, in the same section, there's a link to "opi.org.pl/en/pllum-model-wspoltworzony-przez-opi-pib-gotowy-do-dzialania/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20Polish%20language%20model,on%C2%A0the%20Mixture%20of%20Experts%20architecture." which states "PLLuM model – współtworzony przez OPiPib..." So OPiPib is a co-creator. 

Additionally, the initial mention in the "Zastosowania" section links to CYFRAGOVPL's Hugging Face page. So the creators are CYFRAGOVPL and OPiPib. The answer should list both, citing the relevant parts of the context.
</think>

Odpowiedź: PLLuM został stworzony przez CYFRAGOVPL i współtworzony przez OPiPib. Informacja ta jest zawarta w sekcji „Zalety i wyróżniki” PLLuM, gdzie wspomniano, że „Twórcy stosują licencjonowane treści...” oraz że model „jest współtworzony przez OPiPib” (źródło: [opi.org.pl](opi.org.pl/en/pllum-model-wspoltworzony-przez-opi-pib-gotowy-do-dzialania/)). Dodatkowo, w sekcji „Zastosowania” odniesiono do modelu PLLuM na platformie Hugging Face pod kontrolą CYFRAGOVPL.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's question. They want to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find all mentions of VRAM requirements and see which models fit into a 24 GB VRAM limit. Let me start by recalling the relevant sections.

Looking at the Mistral models first. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB, which is way over 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x22B is 300 GB, so that's out. Codestral 22B is 60 GB, also too much. Codestral Mamba 7B is 16 GB, same as Mistral 7B. Mathstral 7B is 16 GB. Mistral NeMo 12B is 28 GB (bf16) or 16 GB (fp8). Wait, the fp8 version is 16 GB, which is under 24. So Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 could work. Pixtral 12B is 28 GB (bf16) or 16 GB (fp8), so same as NeMo. Mistral Small 24B variants require 60 GB, which is over. Ministral 8B is 24 GB, which matches exactly. Ministral 3B is 8 GB. Mistral Large 2 is 250 GB. Pixtral Large is 250 GB. So Mistral NeMo 12B (fp8), Pixtral 12B (fp8), and Ministral 8B are all within 24 GB.

Now checking LLaMA models. LLaMA 3.1 8B requires 16 GB (FP16), 8 GB (FP8), 4 GB (INT4). So FP16 is 16 GB, which is under 24. LLaMA 3.2 3B is 3.2 GB (FP8) and 1.75 GB (INT4). LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B in INT4 is 10 GB VRAM. LLaMA 4 Scout 17B active/109B total needs 55-60 GB (4-bit), which is over. LLaMA 4 Maverick 17B active/400B total needs 245 GB VRAM. So LLaMA 3.1 8B (FP16), LLaMA 3.2 3B, and LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B (INT4) are possible.

GPT models: GPT-3.5 Turbo uses 16385 tokens but VRAM isn't specified here. GPT-4o requires less than full GPT-4 but details are secret. GPT-OSS 120B needs 80 GB (FP16) or 16 GB (INT4). Wait, GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB. So GPT-OSS 20B in INT4 is 16 GB, which fits. But the user might be referring to the 24 GB. Also, the GPT-OSS 120B in INT4 is 80 GB, which is over. So GPT-OSS 20B is 16 GB, which is under 24.

Now, the user is asking for the best model. The context mentions that Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 uses 16 GB, which is under 24. Similarly, Pixtral 12B in fp8 is 16 GB. Ministral 8B is exactly 24 GB. LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 is 16 GB, and LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B in INT4 is 10 GB. Also, GPT-OSS 20B in INT4 is 16 GB. 

The user might be looking for the model that can utilize the full 24 GB VRAM. The Ministral 8B is exactly 24 GB, so that's a candidate. But some models like Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 (16 GB) or LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 (16 GB) would leave some VRAM unused. However, the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The context mentions that Ministral 8B is for low-latency on-device assistants, which might be a good fit for 24 GB. Also, Mistral NeMo 12B is a replacement for Mistral 7B, which might be better in terms of performance. 

But need to check if the context explicitly states that any of these models are the best. The context for Mistral 8B says it's for low-latency on-device, which could be a good fit. Also, the Ministral 8B is 24 GB, which exactly matches the VRAM. So the answer should include these models. However, the user might be looking for the model that can use the full 24 GB. The Ministral 8B is 24 GB, so that's the one. Also, the GPT-OSS 20B in INT4 is 16 GB, which is under. 

So the best models are Ministral 8B (24 GB), Mistral NeMo 12B (16 GB), Pixtral 12B (16 GB), LLaMA 3.1 8B (16 GB), and GPT-OSS 20B (16 GB). The Ministral 8B uses the full 24 GB, which might be considered the best fit. However, the context mentions that the Ministral 8B is for low-latency on-device, which is a specific use case. The user might be looking for the model that can run on 24 GB, and the Ministral 8B is the only one that exactly matches. So the answer should include Ministral 8B as the best fit for 24 GB VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Na GPU z 24 GB VRAM najlepiej działa **Ministral 8B**, który wymaga dokładnie 24 GB (zgodnie z informacją w kontekście: "Ministral 8B | 8 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 24 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License | niskolatencyjne asystenty on‑device"). Dodatkowo, modele takie jak **Mistral NeMo 12B** (16 GB w trybie fp8), **Pixtral 12B** (16 GB w trybie fp8), **LLaMA 3.1 8B** (16 GB w trybie fp16) oraz **GPT-OSS 20B** (16 GB w trybie int4) również działają w ramach 24 GB, ale Ministral 8B wykorzystuje całą dostępność VRAM, co może być kluczowe dla zadań wymagających optymalnego wykorzystania zasobów.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context information to find all mentions of models and their VRAM requirements. Let's start by recalling the relevant sections from the documents.

Looking at the LLaMA models: 

- LLaMA 3.2 (3B) requires 3B: 6.5 GB VRAM (FP16), 3.2 GB (FP8), 1.75 GB (INT4). So, 24 GB VRAM would easily handle this, but maybe there's a larger model that also fits.

- LLaMA 3.1 8B needs 16 GB VRAM (FP16), 8 GB (FP8), 4 GB (INT4). So 24 GB VRAM can handle this as well. 

- Mistral models: Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM (FP16), which is under 24 GB. Mistral NeMo 12B needs 28 GB VRAM in FP16, which is over 24 GB, but maybe with FP8 it's 16 GB. Wait, the context says Mistral NeMo 12B requires 28 GB (bf16) / 16 GB (fp8). So in FP8, it's 16 GB, which is within 24 GB. But the user might be using FP16, so 28 GB would be too much. But the question is about the best model, so maybe Mistral 7B or Mistral NeMo 12B (FP8) could be candidates.

Wait, the user is asking for the best model. Let's check other models. 

PLLuM models: PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat) requires Q4_K_S ~4.7 GB, Q4_K_M ~4.9 GB, Q5_K_M ~5.6 GB, FP16 ~16.1 GB. So 24 GB would handle FP16. PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) has Q4_K_M ~7.6 GB, Q5_K_M ~8.8 GB, Q6_K ~10.2 GB, Q8_0 ~13.1 GB. So even in higher quantization, it's under 24 GB. PLLuM-70B would require more, so not applicable here.

Looking at Mistral models again: Mistral 7B needs 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is under 24 GB. Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 needs 16 GB VRAM. So both are within 24 GB. But which is better? The user might prefer the one with higher performance. Mistral NeMo 12B has a larger context (128k tokens) and is a more advanced model. However, the context mentions that Mistral NeMo 12B is based on Mistral Nemo 12B, which is a larger model. 

Wait, the context says that PLLuM-12B is based on Mistral Nemo 12B, which requires 12 GB VRAM in FP16. But in the PLLuM-12B entry, the VRAM for Mistral Nemo 12B is mentioned as 12 GB VRAM for 16k context. However, the user's GPU has 24 GB VRAM. So maybe the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 would fit, but the context says that for Mistral NeMo 12B, FP8 requires 16 GB VRAM. 

Alternatively, looking at the LLaMA 3.1 8B model, which in FP16 requires 16 GB VRAM. That's within 24 GB. Also, the Mistral 7B model in FP16 is 16 GB. Both are possible. However, the user is asking for the best model. 

Another model to consider is the PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat), which in FP16 needs 16.1 GB VRAM, which is under 2,4 GB. So that's also a candidate. 

But the question is about the best model. The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small companies due to lower latency and good quality. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which can handle larger models. 

Wait, looking back, the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 requires 16 GB VRAM, which is under 24 GB. The Mistral 7B also requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16. Both are possible. However, the context states that the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 requires 16 GB VRAM, which is also within 24 GB. 

But which one is considered the best? The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is good for small firms, but the user might be looking for a model that can handle more tasks. The Mistral NeMo 12B has a larger context (128k tokens) and is a more advanced model. However, the PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) is based on Mistral Nemo 12B and has a 128k context, which could be better for RAG applications. 

Wait, the PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) is based on Mistral Nemo 12B, which in FP8 requires 16 GB VRAM. So with 24 GB, that's feasible. Also, the PLLuM-12B is a Polish model, which might be more suitable for specific needs. 

But the user didn't specify any language preference. So the best model would depend on the use case. However, the question is about the model that works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. 

Looking at the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 (16 GB VRAM), Mistral 7B in FP16 (16 GB), Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 (16 GB), PLLuM-8B in FP16 (16.1 GB), and PLLuM-12B in FP8 (16 GB). All of these fit within 24 GB. 

But which one is considered the best? The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small firms due to low latency and good quality. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which can handle larger models. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 requires 16 GB VRAM. The Mistral 7B in FP16 is 16 GB. The Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 is 16 GB. The PLLuM-12B in FP8 is 16 GB. All of these are within 24 GB. 

The context also mentions that the Mistral NeMo 12B has a larger context (128k tokens) and is a more advanced model. So if the user needs a model with a longer context, Mistral NeMo 12B (FP8) would be a good choice. 

However, the user might prefer a model that's more optimized for their specific tasks. The LLaMA 3.1 8B is known for its performance in benchmarks and efficiency. 

But the question is about the best model given the VRAM. Since all these models fit, the answer should be the one that's highlighted in the context as optimal. 

Looking back, the context says that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small companies due to lower latency and good quality. But the user's GPU is 24 GB, which can handle larger models. 

Wait, another model to consider is the PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) which is based on Mistral Nemo 12B. It requires 16 GB VRAM in FP8. The context states that PLLuM-12B is intended for advanced language tasks and can be used with RAG. 

So, considering all options, the best model that fits 24 GB VRAM would be the one that offers the best performance for the user's needs. Since the user didn't specify the use case, but the question is about the model that works best on 24 GB VRAM, the answer should include the models that fit and are highlighted in the context. 

The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small firms, but the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is more than enough for that model. However, the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 requires 16 GB VRAM, which is within 24 GB. 

Another point: the Mistral NeMo 12B has a larger context (128k tokens) and is a more advanced model. So if the user needs a model with longer context, that's better. 

Therefore, the best model for 24 GB VRAM would be the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8, which requires 16 GB VRAM. Alternatively, the PLLuM-12B (based on Mistral Nemo 12B) in FP8. 

But the context also mentions that PLLuM-12B is based on Mistral Nemo 12B and has a 128k context. So the PLLuM-12B would be a good candidate. 

However, the question is about the model that works best, and the context states that the Mistral NeMo 12B is a more advanced model. 

In conclusion, the best model for 24 GB VRAM would be the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8, which requires 16 GB VRAM, or the PLLuM-12B (based on Mistral Nemo 12B) in FP8. But since the user asked for the model name, the answer should include the specific models mentioned in the context. 

Looking back at the context, the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 requires 16 GB VRAM, which is also within 24 GB. 

The answer should list all the models that fit within 24 GB VRAM and are highlighted in the context. The user might need to choose based on their specific requirements, but the question is about the model that works best, so the answer should include the models that are recommended for their respective use cases. 

The context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small companies, but the user has a larger GPU. The Mistral NeMo 12B is a larger model with better context length. 

So, the best model for 24 GB VRAM would be the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 (16 GB VRAM) or the PLLuM-12B (based on Mistral Nemo 12B) in FP8. However, the exact model names need to be checked. 

The context says that the Mistral NeMo 12B requires 16 GB VRAM in FP8, which is under 24 GB. The PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) is based on Mistral Nemo 12B and requires 16 GB VRAM in FP8. 

Therefore, the answer should include these models. However, the user might prefer the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 (16 GB VRAM) as it's a well-known model. 

But the question is about the best model, which could depend on the use case. Since the user didn't specify, the answer should list the models that fit and are mentioned in the context. 

The final answer should be the Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8, as it's a larger model with better context and is within the VRAM limit. Alternatively, PLLuM-12B (based on Mistral Nemo 12B) is also a candidate. But the exact model names need to be extracted from the context.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context information to find relevant parts. The context includes several documents about different models like LLaMA, PLLuM, GPT, and Mistral. Each document has sections about their specifications, including VRAM requirements.

Starting with the LLaMA section: The document mentions that the LLaMA 3 8B model can run on a GPU with 16 GB VRAM. However, the 70B model requires much more, like 140 GB VRAM. The 8B model is suitable for single GPU with 16 GB VRAM. But the user's GPU has 24 GB VRAM, which is more than 16 GB. So maybe the 8B model could work here, but there's also the Mistral models to consider.

Looking at the Mistral document, there's a table with models and their VRAM requirements. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB, which is way over 24 GB. The Mistral Small 24B requires 60 GB VRAM, which is still more than 24. However, there's a model called Ministral 8B which requires 24 GB VRAM. That seems to fit exactly. 

Another entry in the Mistral table is the Ministral 3B, which needs 8 GB VRAM, but that's lower than 24. The user's GPU has 24 GB, so the 8B model (Ministral 8B) is the one that matches the VRAM requirement. 

Also, in the PLLuM document, the Llama-PLLuM-8B model requires around 4.7 GB to 5.6 GB VRAM when quantized, which is well within 24 GB. But the question is about the best model, so maybe considering performance. The Mistral 8B has a higher parameter count (7.3B) compared to PLLuM's 8B, which might offer better performance. However, the Mistral 8B's VRAM requirement is exactly 24 GB, which matches the user's GPU. 

Wait, the Mistral 8B's VRAM is listed as 16 GB in the table. Wait, no, the table says Mistral 7B is 16 GB, and the Ministral 8B (which is a different model) is listed as requiring 24 GB. Let me check again. 

In the Mistral document's table, the "Ministral 8B" entry has a Min. VRAM of 24 GB. That's the one. So the Ministral 8B model requires exactly 24 GB VRAM. Also, the Mistral 7B needs 16 GB, which is under 24, but the user might want the best model possible. The Ministral 8B is a better choice here because it's a higher parameter model (8B vs 7B) and fits the VRAM. 

Additionally, the LLaMA 3 8B model can run on 16 GB VRAM, but with 24 GB, maybe it's possible to run larger models. However, the Mistral 8B is specifically listed for 24 GB. 

So the answer should be the Ministral 8B model, which requires exactly 24 GB VRAM as per the Mistral document's table. Also, the PLLuM 8B models have lower VRAM requirements, but the Ministral 8B is a better fit for the given VRAM. 

Wait, but the user's GPU is 24 GB. The Mistral 8B requires 24 GB, so that's the exact match. Other models like the Mistral 7B (16 GB) or PLLuM 8B (around 4.7-5.6 GB) would have lower requirements, but the user is asking for the best model that works on 24 GB. The Ministral 8B is the one that uses the full 24 GB, which might offer better performance. 

Therefore, the answer is the Ministral 8B model, as it's specifically listed to require 24 GB VRAM.

Odpowiedź: Najlepiej działa model **Ministral 8B**, który wymaga dokładnie **24 GB VRAM** (zgodnie z tabelą w dokumencie dotyczącym modeli Mistral). W kontekście przedstawionym w pliku `mistal.txt` model ten jest opisany jako wymagający 24 GB VRAM, co idealnie odpowiada dostępności 24 GB na karcie graficznej. Dodatkowo, modele PLLuM 8B (np. Llama-PLLuM-8B) wymagają znacznie mniej VRAM (ok. 4,7–5,6 GB w kwantyzacji Q4_K_S), ale Ministral 8B oferuje wyższy poziom parametrów (7,3 mld) i lepszą jakość wnioskowania dla danego rozmiaru pamięci.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to figure out which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM based on the provided context. Let me start by reviewing the context information carefully.

First, looking at the LLaMA models. The LLaMA 3.1 8B model requires around 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model needs 1.75 GB in INT4, 3.2 GB in FP8, and 2.5 GB in FP16. The LLaMA 3.2 Vision models have higher VRAM requirements, so they might not fit into 24 GB. The LLaMA 4 Scout model with 17B active parameters needs 55-60 GB VRAM in 4-bit quantization, which is way over 24 GB. So LLaMA models might not be the best fit here.

Next, the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B model requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is close to 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x7B model needs 100 GB in full precision, but with 4-bit quantization, it's around 22.5 GB VRAM. Wait, the user has 24 GB, which is slightly less than 22.5 GB? No, 24 GB is more than 22.5 GB. Wait, the Mixtral 8x7B in 4-bit quantization requires about 22.5 GB VRAM. That's under 24 GB. But the Mistral 7B in FP16 needs 16 GB, which is also within 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B might be a better fit because it's a single model, while Mixtral is a MoE model with multiple experts. Also, the Mistral 7B's FP16 requirement is 16 GB, which leaves room for other processes. 

Looking at other models, the GPT-OSS 20B model can run on a 16 GB GPU with 4-bit quantization. The GPT-OSS 120B needs 80 GB, which is over 24 GB. The Mistral Small 24B models require 60 GB VRAM, which is too much. The PLLuM-12B model with Mistral Nemo 12B needs around 12 GB VRAM in 4-bit quantization, which is well under 24 GB. But the PLLuM-12B is based on Mistral Nemo 12B, which might have different requirements. Wait, the PLLuM-12B's quantized versions range from 4.9 GB to 13.1 GB in VRAM, so 24 GB would easily handle that. However, the question is about which model "best" works. The Mistral 7B is a single model with lower VRAM usage, while the PLLuM-12B is a Polish model based on Mistral, which might have similar VRAM needs. 

But the user's question is about the best model for a 24 GB GPU. The Mistral 7B in FP16 uses 16 GB, which is within 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x7B in 4-bit quantization uses 22.5 GB, which is also within 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B is a single model, which might be simpler to run. The PLLuM-12B's 4-bit quantization requires around 4.9 GB to 10.2 GB, which is much lower. But the PLLuM-3B model uses 0.75 GB in INT4, which is even less. However, the question is about the best model, not the smallest. 

Wait, the user might be looking for a model that can utilize the 24 GB VRAM effectively. The Mistral 7B in FP16 uses 16 GB, leaving 8 GB for other tasks. The Mixtral 8x7B in 4-bit uses 22.5 GB, which is close to 24 GB. The GPT-OSS 20B in 4-bit is 16 GB. The PLLuM-12B in 4-bit is around 4.9 GB to 10.2 GB. So the Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B are closer to the 24 GB limit. However, the Mixtral 8x7B is a MoE model, which might have more complex requirements. 

The GPT-OSS 20B is also a candidate. The user might prefer a model that can run efficiently on 24 GB. The Mistral 7B is a single model, so it might be more straightforward. The answer should be based on the context provided. The context mentions that Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, which is within 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x7B in 4-bit uses 22.5 GB, which is also under 24 GB. However, the Mistral 7B is a single model, so it's more likely to be the best fit for a 24 GB GPU. The answer should highlight Mistral 7B and possibly the GPT-OSS 20B as well. But the context also mentions that the PLLuM-12B in 4-bit uses around 7.6 GB, which is much lower. However, the question is about the best model, which might depend on the specific use case. The context also states that the Mistral 7B is a good starting point for many new models. So the best model for 24 GB VRAM would be Mistral 7B in FP16 or the GPT-OSS 20B in 4-bit. But the user might need to check which one is available. The answer should include these models based on the context.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find information about VRAM requirements for different models. Let me scan through each relevant section.

Looking at the PLLum.txt document, there's mention of the 70B model needing over 90 GB VRAM in fp16, which is way above 24 GB. The 12B model is more consumer-friendly, but I need to check if it's within 24 GB. However, the exact VRAM for 12B isn't specified here. 

Next, the Mistral.txt documents. The Mistral 7B model is noted to require around 16 GB VRAM in bf16, but with 4-bit quantization, it can run on 4 GB VRAM. However, the user's GPU has 24 GB, which is more than enough for the 7B model. Also, the Mistral Large 2 model needs about 233 GB VRAM in full precision, which is way too high. The Mistral Large 2.1 version might have similar requirements. 

In the LLaMA.txt document, the 7B model requires around 12-13 GB VRAM in FP16, and quantized versions can run on 6 GB. The 13B model needs ~24 GB VRAM in full precision, which is exactly the user's GPU capacity. The 65B model is way beyond. 

Wait, the user's GPU is 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B model in full precision needs ~24 GB VRAM. That's a match. Also, the Mistral 7B in bf16 requires 16 GB, which is under 24. But the user might prefer a model that can use the full 24 GB for better performance. 

However, the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The LLaMA 13B would use the full 24 GB, but maybe the Mistral 7B is more optimized. Wait, the Mistral 7B's bf16 version needs 16 GB, which leaves 8 GB unused. But if the user can use quantization, the Mistral 7B can run on 4 GB, but that's not utilizing the full 24 GB. 

Alternatively, the LLaMA 13B in full precision uses exactly 24 GB. That's a direct match. However, the context mentions that the LLaMA 13B is available under a research license. But the user's main constraint is the VRAM. 

Wait, in the Mistral section, the Mistral 7B can be run in bf16 with 16 GB VRAM, which is under 24. But the LLaMA 13B requires 24 GB. So both models can run on 24 GB, but which is better? The context doesn't specify which model is better in terms of performance, but the VRAM requirement is exact for LLaMA 13B. 

But the user might prefer the Mistral 7B because it's more recent and has features like 128k context. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that the Mistral 7B is better in terms of performance on 24 GB. 

Wait, the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" on 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B uses exactly 24 GB, which is the maximum. The Mistral 7B uses 16 GB, which is less. But maybe the LLaMA 13B would perform better with the full VRAM. However, the context doesn't compare their performance. 

Alternatively, the Mistral 7B can use 4-bit quantization to run on 4 GB, but that's not using the full 24. The user's GPU has 24 GB, so the LLaMA 13B is the one that uses the full capacity. But the context mentions that the LLaMA 13B is under a research license. 

The user's query is about which model works best on 24 GB. The answer should be based on the VRAM requirements. The LLaMA 13B requires exactly 24 GB, so it's the one that can utilize the full VRAM. However, the Mistral 7B in bf16 uses 16 GB, which is under 2, but maybe it's more efficient. 

But the context doesn't mention performance differences. Therefore, the LLaMA 13B is the one that uses the 24 GB, so it's the best fit. However, the user might prefer a model that can use more VRAM for better performance. 

Wait, the context says that the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs 24 GB. So that's the exact match. Therefore, the answer should be LLaMA 13B. But I need to check if there are other models that can use 24 GB. 

Looking back, the Mistral Large 2 requires 233 GB, which is way over. The Mistral 7B in bf16 is 16 GB. The LLaMA 13B is 24 GB. The PLLum 12B might have lower requirements, but the exact VRAM isn't specified. 

So the LLaMA 13B is the model that requires exactly 24 GB VRAM. Therefore, it's the best fit for the 24 GB GPU. But wait, the user's GPU is 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B in full precision needs 24 GB, which is exactly the capacity. So that's the model that would use the full VRAM. 

Therefore, the answer is LLaMA 13B. But I need to check the context again. In the LLaMA section, the 13B model in full precision needs ~24 GB VRAM. That's the exact match for the 24 GB GPU. So the LLaMA 13B is the best fit.

Odpowiedź:  
Na GPU z 24 GB VRAM najlepiej działa model **LLaMA 13B** w pełnej precyzji (FP16), który wymaga dokładnie 24 GB VRAM. Warto zaznaczyć, że model ten jest dostępny w ramach licencji badawczej i oferuje wydajność dla zastosowań RAG. W przypadku modeli Mistral, np. Mistral 7B w wersji bf16 wymaga ok. 16 GB VRAM, co pozwala na uruchomienie na 24 GB, ale nie wykorzystuje pełnej pojemności. W kontekście wydajności i dopasowania do dostępnych zasobów, LLaMA 13B jest optymalnym wyborem.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's question. They want to know the minimum VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the provided context to find all the models and their VRAM requirements. The context has several sections discussing different LLaMA models, Mistral models, and PLLuM. The user is specifically asking about the smallest LLM, so I should focus on the models with the fewest parameters.

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's LLaMA 1 with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 has 7B, 13B, 70B. Code Llama has 7B, 13B, 30B/34B. LLaMA 3.1 includes 8B and 70B. LLaMA 3.2 has 1B and 3B. LLaMA 4 Scout is 17B active. Mistral models include 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, etc. PLLuM has 8B, 12B, 70B, and 8x7B.

The smallest parameter count here seems to be the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2. The context mentions that the 1B model requires 2.5GB VRAM in FP16, 1.25GB in FP8, and 0.75GB in INT4. The 3B model in LLaMA 3.2 is next, needing 6.5GB VRAM in FP16. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the smallest model. The 1B model is smaller than 3B. However, I should check if there are any other models with even fewer parameters. For example, Mistral's Ministral 3B is 3B, and Mistral 7B is 7B. PLLuM's 8B is 8B. The LLaMA 3.2 1B is the smallest mentioned here. 

So the answer should be the 1B model, which requires 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. The context specifies that for the 1B model, the INT4 quantization uses 0.75GB VRAM. Therefore, the smallest model is LLaMA 3.2 1B with 0.75GB VRAM. I need to confirm that there's no smaller model mentioned. The 1B is the smallest in the context. The answer should be based on the 1B model's INT4 requirement.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Aby odpalić najmniejszy model LLM, potrzeba **0,75 GB VRAM** dla wersji **LLaMA 3.2 1B** w kwantyzacji INT4.  

**Podstawy:**  
- W kontekście podano, że model **LLaMA 3.2 1B** wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w trybie **INT4** (patrz sekcja LLaMA 3.2: „3 B: 6,5 GB VRAM (FP16), 3,2 GB (FP8), 1,75 GB (INT4); 1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)”).  
- To najmniejszy model wymieniony w dokumentach, ponieważ inne wersje (np. Mistral 3B, PLLuM 8B) mają więcej parametrów (3B, 8B).

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find all mentions of LLM models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files related to different models like PLLuM, LLaMA, Mistral, and others. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2-1B and 3.2-3B models. The VRAM requirements for these are specified. For example, the 3B model requires about 6.5GB VRAM in FP16, 3.2GB in FP8, and 1.75GB in INT4. The 1B model needs 2.5GB in FP16, 1.25GB in FP8, and 0.75GB in INT4. 

Comparing these, the smallest model in terms of parameters is the 1B model. The VRAM requirement for the 1B model in INT4 is 0.75GB. However, the context also mentions other models like Mistral's 3B (which requires 8GB VRAM in INT4) and PLLuM's 8B model, but those are larger. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the smallest LLM. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is 1 billion parameters, which is smaller than the 3B model. So the 1B model would be the smallest. The VRAM needed for the 1B model in INT4 is 0.75GB. However, the context also mentions the LLaMA 3.2-3B model, which is larger. 

But I need to confirm if there's any smaller model mentioned. The PLLuM models start at 8B, which is larger. The Mistral models start at 7B. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest in the context. 

So the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. However, the user might be asking for the minimal VRAM regardless of quantization. If they want the minimal VRAM, the INT4 quantization for 1B is 0.75GB. But if they're asking for the minimal VRAM without quantization, maybe the FP16 requirement is higher. But the question doesn't specify the quantization, so the minimal VRAM would be in the INT4 case. 

Wait, the user's question is about the smallest model, so the 1B model is the smallest. The VRAM needed for the 1B model in INT4 is 0.75GB. Therefore, the answer is 0.75GB VRAM for the LLaMA 3.2-1B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najmniejszy model LLM wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w formacie INT4. Jest to model **LLaMA 3.2-1B** (1 mld parametrów).  

**Oparcie:**  
- W dokumencie podano, że model **LLaMA 3.2-1B** wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w precyzji INT4 (zobacz sekcję "LLaMA 3.2 (wrzesień 2024)").  
- Brak mniejszych modeli w kontekście (np. PLLuM 8B, Mistral 7B, LLaMA 3.1 8B itp. mają więcej parametrów niż 1 mld).

Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the context. 

First, I need to identify which model is considered the smallest. Looking through the provided context, there's information about several models: Llama-PLLuM-8B, PLLuM-12B, PLLuM-70B, and PLLuM-8×7B. The 8B models are likely the smallest since 8 billion parameters is less than 12B, 70B, or 8×7B (which is around 45B active parameters).

Next, I need to find the VRAM requirements for the 8B model. In the context, under the "Dostępne modele PLLuM" section, the Llama-PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat) entry mentions that the full FP16 precision requires about 16.1 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking for the smallest model, so I should check if there's a smaller model mentioned. Wait, the Llama-PLLuM-8B is the 8B variant, and the other models are larger. 

Wait, there's also a mention of LLaMA 3 models in the llama.txt file. The LLaMA 3 8B model is noted to require around 16 GB VRAM in full precision. But the user is asking about the smallest LLM in the context. The PLLuM-8B is part of the PLLuM family, but the LLaMA 3 8B is another model. However, the user's context includes both PLLuM and LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's context includes both PLLuM and LLaMA models. The question is about the smallest LLM, so I need to check all models mentioned. The PLLuM-8B is 8B parameters, and the LLaMA 3 8B is also 8B. However, the context mentions that the LLaMA 3 8B requires 16 GB VRAM in full FP16. But the PLLuM-8B's VRAM requirement is listed as 16.1 GB for FP16. 

But the user is asking for the smallest model. Since both PLLuM-8B and LLaMA 3 8B are 8B, but the context mentions that the LLaMA 3 8B can be run on a single GPU with 16 GB VRAM. However, the PLLuM-8B's VRAM requirement is 16.1 GB for FP16. 

Wait, the user is asking about the smallest model. The smallest in terms of parameters is 8B, but there's also a mention of a 3B model in the LLaMA 3.2 variant. However, the context for LLaMA 3.2 is in the llama.txt file, which mentions that the 3B model is recommended for small businesses. But the user's context includes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model. 

Wait, the user's context includes a section about LLaMA 3.2 in the llama.txt file. The entry says: "Modele 3.1 i 4 mogą obsługiwać kontekst od 128 k do milionów tokenów, co pozwala na wbudowanie dużych baz wiedzy bez konieczności intensywnego indeksowania. Jednak ich wymagania sprzętowe i koszty eksploatacji są wysokie – w praktyce lepiej zastosować mniejsze warianty (8 B lub 24 B) i wspierać się mechanizmami przycinania kontekstu." 

Wait, but the 3B model isn't explicitly mentioned here. However, in the "Wnioski i rekomendacje" section of the llama.txt file, it says: "Dla zastosowań RAG w małych firmach rekomendowane są modele 8 B (LLaMA 3) lub 3 B (LLaMA 3.2), które zapewniają dobrą jakość i niskie opóźnienia." So the 3B model is mentioned here. 

But the user is asking about the smallest model in the context. The 3B model is smaller than the 8B models. However, the context for the 3B model is in the LLaMA 3.2 section. The user's question is about the smallest LLM, so the 3B model would be the smallest. 

But wait, the user's context includes the PLLuM-8B (8B) and LLaMA 3.2 3B. So the smallest is the 3B model. However, the VRAM requirement for the 3B model isn't explicitly stated in the context. The context mentions that the 8B model requires 16 GB VRAM, but the 3B model's VRAM isn't specified. 

Wait, the user's context includes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model. The entry in the llama.txt says: "Modele 3.1 i 4 mogą obsługiwać kontekst od 128 k do milionów tokenów..." but doesn't specify VRAM for the 3B. However, the Wnioski i rekomendacje section mentions that for small businesses, 8B or 3B models are recommended. But the VRAM for 3B isn't given. 

Alternatively, maybe the smallest model in the context is the PLLuM-8B, which is 8B parameters. However, the LLaMA 3.2 3B is smaller. But the VRAM for the 3B isn't mentioned. 

Wait, the user's context for the LLaMA 3.2 3B is in the "Wnioski i rekomendacje" section. The text says: "Dla zastosowań RAG w małych firmach rekomendowane są modele 8 B (LLaMA 3) lub 3 B (LLaMA 3.2), które zapewniają dobrą jakość i niskie opóźnienia." But there's no VRAM info for the 3B model. 

Therefore, the smallest model mentioned in the context is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM requirement isn't specified. However, the user's question is about the smallest model, and if the 3B is the smallest, but VRAM isn't given, then the answer would be that the 3B model is the smallest, but the VRAM is not specified. 

Wait, but the user's question is to find the smallest model and its VRAM. If the 3B model is the smallest, but the VRAM isn't mentioned, then the answer would be that the smallest model is LLaMA 3.2 3B, but the VRAM isn't provided in the context. However, the user's context for the 8B models (LLaMA 3 8B and PLLuM-8B) specifies VRAM. 

Wait, the user's context for the LLaMA 3.1 8B model says: "Model Llama 3 70 B w pełnej precyzji potrzebuje ponad 140 GB VRAM, a specjalne techniki kwantyzacji (np. 4-bit) pozwalają uruchomić go na pojedynczym GPU RTX 4090 (24 GB) kosztem wydajności." But that's for the 70B model. The 8B model is mentioned as needing 16 GB VRAM. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.1 8B model's VRAM is 16 GB. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model isn't mentioned with VRAM. So perhaps the smallest model in the context is the LLaMA 3.2 3B, but since VRAM isn't specified, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B model, but VRAM isn't provided. However, the user's context may not have that info. 

Alternatively, the PLLuM-8B is the smallest model mentioned in the PLLuM section, and its VRAM is 16.1 GB for FP16. But the LLaMA 3.2 3B is smaller, but VRAM isn't given. 

Wait, the user's question is about the smallest LLM, so if the context doesn't mention the 3B's VRAM, then the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM is not specified. However, the user's context might not have that info. 

But the user's context includes the LLaMA 3.1 8B and PLLuM-8B models with VRAM info. The 3B model is mentioned but without VRAM. So the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM is not specified in the context. However, the user's context might not have that info. 

Alternatively, maybe the smallest model is the PLLuM-8B, which is 8B parameters. The VRAM for the 8B model is 16.1 GB. But the 3B model is smaller. However, the VRAM for the 3B isn't mentioned. 

Therefore, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM isn't specified. However, the user's context might not have that info. Alternatively, if the 8B is the smallest mentioned with VRAM, then that's the answer. 

But the user's question is about the smallest model. If the 3B is the smallest, but VRAM isn't given, then the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM isn't provided. However, the user's context may not have that info. 

But the user's context includes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model, but no VRAM info. Therefore, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM is not specified. However, the user's context may not have that info. 

Wait, but in the context, the LLaMA 3.2 3B is mentioned as a recommended model for small businesses, but without VRAM. Therefore, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM is not specified in the context. However, the user's question requires the answer to be based on the context. If the context doesn't mention the 3B's VRAM, then the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B, but VRAM isn't provided. 

Alternatively, the smallest model in the context is the PLLuM-8B, which is 8B parameters, and its VRAM is 16.1 GB. But if there's a smaller model (like 3B) with VRAM info, that's the answer. 

Wait, the user's context for the LLaMA 3.2 3B is in the "Wnioski i rekomendacje" section, which says: "Dla zastosowań RAG w małych firmach rekomendowane są modele 8 B (LLaMA 3) lub 3 B (LLaMA 3.2), które zapewniają dobrą jakość i niskie opóźnienia." But there's no VRAM info for the 3B model. 

Therefore, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VRAM isn't provided in the context. However, the user's context may not have that info. 

But the user's question requires the answer to be based on the context. If the context doesn't mention the 3B's VRAM, then the answer would be that the smallest model is the 3B LLaMA 3.2, but the VR, but the VRAM is not specified. 

Alternatively, the smallest model in the context is the PLLuM-8B with 8B parameters, and its VRAM is 16.1 GB. So the answer would be 16.1 GB for the PLLuM-8B. 

But the user's context also mentions the LLaMA 3.1 8B model requiring 16 GB VRAM. So the smallest model would be the 8B model, and the VRAM is 16 GB. 

Wait, the context for PLLuM-8B says: "Przybliżone rozmiary kwantyzacji: Q4_K_S ok. 4,7 GB, Q4_K_M ok. 4,9 GB, Q5_K_M ok. 5,6 GB, pełne FP16 ~16,1 GB." So the full FP16 requires 16.1 GB. 

The LLaMA 3.1 8B model's VRAM is mentioned as 16 GB. So the smallest model is the 8B, and the VRAM is 16 GB. 

Therefore, the answer is that the smallest model is LLaMA 3.1 8B, requiring 16 GB VRAM. 

But the user's context includes both PLLuM-8B and LLaMA 3.1 8B. The question is about the smallest LLM, so if there's a 3B model, that's smaller, but the VRAM isn't mentioned. 

But since the user's context doesn't mention the 3B model's VRAM, and the 8B models are mentioned with VRAM, the answer would be that the smallest model is the 8B model, which requires 16 GB VRAM. 

So the answer is the LLaMA 3.1 8B model requires 16 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's question. They want to know the minimum VRAM required to run the smallest LLM based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find information about LLaMA models. The user mentioned "najmniejszy model llm," which translates to the smallest LLM. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a table listing different models. The first entry is LLaMA 1 with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2, Code Llama, and so on. The LLaMA 3.1 section mentions an 8B model. Wait, but there's also a mention of LLaMA 3.2 with 1B and 3B models. 

Wait, in the LLaMA 3.2 section, there's a model called "LLaMA 3.2‑Vision (11 B/90 B)" but that's larger. Then there's "LLaMA 4 Scout (17 B aktywnych, 109 B całkowitych)" which is bigger. 

Wait, looking back, in the LLaMA section under "LLaMA 3.1 (lipiec 2024)" there's a mention of the 8B model. But then in the LLaMA 3.2 section, there's a 1B and 3B model. Let me check again.

In the LLaMA 3.2 section, the table lists "LLaMA 3.2‑Vision (11 B/90 B)" but the 1B and 3B models are mentioned under "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)". Wait, the user is asking for the smallest model. The 1B model would be smaller than the 3B. 

Wait, looking at the LLaMA 3.2 section, there's a model called "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" with 1B and 3B parameters. The 1B model would be the smallest. 

But I need to check the VRAM requirements for that. In the LLaMA 3.1 section, the 8B model requires 16GB VRAM in FP16. However, the 1B model might have lower requirements. 

Wait, in the LLaMA 3.2 section, the "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" has a row with "1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)". So the 1B model in FP16 requires 2.5 GB VRAM. 

But wait, the user is asking for the smallest model. The 1B model is the smallest among the LLaMA 3.2 variants. However, there's also the Mistral models mentioned. For example, Mistral 7B requires 16GB VRAM in FP16. But the user is specifically asking about LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's question is about the smallest LLM, but the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. However, the user might be referring to LLaMA. But the question is phrased as "najmniejszy model llm" which is general. But the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral. 

Wait, the user's first question is about the smallest LLM, but the context has multiple models. However, the user's instruction says to answer based on the provided context. Let me check again.

In the LLaMA section, the smallest model mentioned is the 1B model under LLaMA 3.2. The VRAM required for that model in FP16 is 2.5 GB. However, there's also the Mistral 7B model which requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16. So the smallest model in terms of parameters is the 1B LLaMA 3.2 model, which requires 2.5 GB VRAM. 

But wait, the user might be referring to the smallest model across all models mentioned, not just LLaMA. However, the question is phrased as "najmniejszy model llm" which could be interpreted as the smallest LLM in the context. The LLaMA 3.2 1B model is the smallest in terms of parameters. 

So the answer would be the LLaMA 3.2 1B model requiring 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. However, I need to confirm if there's any smaller model. 

Looking again, there's also the Mistral 3B model which requires 8 GB VRAM in FP16. But the LLaMA 1B model is smaller. 

Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2 1B model with 2.5 GB VRAM. The context mentions this in the LLaMA section under "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" with the line "1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)".

Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find any mentions of the smallest model. The context includes several files related to PLLuM, Mistral, and LLaMA models. 

Looking at the PLLuM section, there's a table listing different models. The Llama-PLLuM-8B is mentioned with a VRAM requirement of around 4.7 GB when using Q4_K_S quantization. However, the user is asking about the smallest model, so I should check if there's a smaller one.

In the Mistral section, there's a mention of Ministral 3B and 8B models. The Ministral 3B is noted to require a minimum of 8 GB VRAM. That's smaller than the 8B model from PLLuM. 

Then, in the LLaMA section, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2 3B, which is also a 3B model. The context states that the 3B model can be run on a single GPU with 16 GB VRAM. However, the Ministral 3B is mentioned as requiring 8 GB VRAM, which is less than 16 GB. 

Wait, but the user is asking specifically about the smallest model. The Ministral 3B is 3B parameters, which is smaller than the 8B models. However, the LLaMA 3.2 3B is also 3B. The context mentions that the Ministral 3B requires 8 GB VRAM, which is less than the 16 GB needed for the LLaMA 3.2 3B. 

Wait, no. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is mentioned as needing 16 GB VRAM? Let me check again. In the LLaMA section under "LLaMA 1 (2023)", the 7B model requires 12-13 GB VRAM in FP16. The 3B model isn't mentioned there. Then, in the LLaMA section under "LLaMA 2 (lipiec 2023)", there's Code Llama with 7B and 13B, but not 3B. 

Wait, looking back, in the Mistral section under "Ministral 3B i 8B", it says the 3B model requires a minimum of 8 GB VRAM. That's the smallest mentioned. The LLaMA 3.2 3B isn't mentioned in the context provided. The only 3B model mentioned is Ministral 3B. 

Therefore, the smallest model in the context is Ministral 3B, requiring 8 GB VRAM. The LLaMA 3.2 3B isn't mentioned here, so the answer should be Ministral 3B with 8 GB VRAM.
