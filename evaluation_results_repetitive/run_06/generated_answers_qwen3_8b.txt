Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking at the context, the main topics are about various AI models like GPT, Mistral, and others. There's detailed information on their parameters, licenses, and use cases. However, I don't see any mention of Sam Altman in the provided texts. The documents discuss model versions, technical specs, and company information like OpenAI and Mistral AI, but no personal details about Sam Altman. 

Since the user specified that the answer must be based solely on the given context and not prior knowledge, and there's no mention of Sam Altman in the provided fragments, the correct response is to state that the information isn't found in the documents. I need to make sure not to include any external knowledge here. The answer should be precise as per the instructions.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. 

First, I need to go through the context information carefully. The context has several sections discussing different versions of LLaMA, like LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, and others. Each section lists the models available in each generation.

Starting with LLaMA 1, the context mentions models with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 adds 7B, 13B, and 70B. Code Llama is a variant under LLaMA 2 with 7B, 13B, 30B, 34B. 

LLaMA 3 includes 8B and 70B. LLaMA 3.1 expands to 8B, 70B, 405B. LLaMA 3.2 introduces 1B, 3B, and Vision models like 11B and 90B. LLaMA 4 has Scout (17B active, 109B total) and Maverick (17B active, 400B total). 

I need to list all these models with their parameters and any additional info like VRAM requirements or licenses, but the user's question is just about which models are available. The answer should include all the model variants mentioned in the context. 

I should make sure not to include any models not mentioned in the provided text. For example, the context doesn't mention any models beyond LLaMA 4, so I shouldn't add anything beyond that. Also, check if there are any other models mentioned in the sections. 

Looking back, the answer should list each model generation with their respective sizes. The user wants the answer fully supported by the context, so each model mentioned must be backed by the context fragments. 

So the final answer should list all the models from each generation as per the context, including their parameter counts and any relevant details like VRAM or licenses if necessary, but the main focus is on the availability.
</think>

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections of the PLLuM document. Under the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM is a project of a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by the Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, IP PAN, Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji PIB, University of Łódź, and Institute of Slavistics PAN. That seems like the main answer.

I should check if there's any other mention of creators elsewhere. The "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section also states that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization on February 24, 2025, but it doesn't mention the creators. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" (Advantages and Distinctions) section doesn't add new info about the creators. 

The user wants the answer fully supported by the context. The key sentence is in the "Tło i motywacja" part. I need to make sure not to include any external knowledge. The answer should list the consortium members and the coordinating institution. Also, the user specified to avoid mentioning the context directly, so I need to paraphrase the information found there.
</think>

Odpowiedź: PLLuM został stworzony przez konsorcjum polskich uczelni i instytutów, koordynowane przez Politechnikę Wrocławską, wraz z udziałem NASK PIB, Instytutu Podstaw Informatyki PAN, Ośrodka Przetwarzania Informacji PIB, Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego oraz Instytutu Slawistyki PAN. Informacja ta została zawarta w sekcji „Tło i motywacja” dokumentu, gdzie opisano, że projekt został zaprezentowany przez Ministerstwo Cyfryzacji w 2025 roku.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. I need to look through the provided context to find models that fit this VRAM requirement.

First, I'll scan the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM. Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB, which is way over 24 GB. Mixtral 8x22B is 300 GB, nope. Codestral 22B is 60 GB, still too much. Codestral Mamba 7B is 16 GB, which is under 24. Mathstral 7B is also 16 GB. Mistral NeMo 12B is 28 GB in bf16, which is over 24. Pixtral 12B is 28 GB as well. Mistral Small 24B variants need 60 GB. Magistral Small 24B is 60 GB. Devstral Small 24B is 60 GB. Voxtral Small 24B is 60 GB. Voxtral Mini 3B is 8 GB. Ministral 8B is 24 GB. Ministral 3B is 8 GB. Mistral Large 2 is 250 GB. Pixtral Large is 250 GB. 

Looking at the LLaMA models, LLaMA 3.1 8B requires 16 GB VRAM (FP16), which is under 24. LLaMA 3.1 70B needs 140 GB, too much. LLaMA 3.2 3B is 6.5 GB (FP16) and 3.2 GB (FP8). LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B is 10 GB (INT4). LLaMA 4 Scout is 55-60 GB (4-bit), which is over 24. LLaMA 4 Maverick is 245 GB, nope. 

In the GPT models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo have high VRAM requirements, like 350 GB for GPT-3. GPT-4o is lower but specifics are not given. GPT-OSS models: gpt-oss-120b needs 80 GB, which is over 24. gpt-oss-20b is 16 GB. 

Now, checking the PLLuM model, the 12B variant needs 16 GB VRAM. 

So, models that fit 24 GB VRAM include: 
- Mistral 7B (16 GB), Codestral Mamba 7B (16 GB), Mathstral 7B (16 GB), Ministral 8B (24 GB), LLaMA 3.1 8B (16 GB), LLaMA 3.2 3B (FP16: 6.5 GB), LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B (INT4: 10 GB), and PLLuM 12B (16 GB). 

But the user is asking for the best model. The Ministral 8B is exactly 24 GB, which might be the optimal fit. Also, the Mistral 7B and Codestral Mamba 7B are under 24 GB but might have lower performance. The LLaMA 3.1 8B is also a good candidate. However, the context mentions that Ministral 8B is designed for low-latency on-device use, which might make it a better fit for the 24 GB VRAM. 

Wait, the context for Mistral 8B says it requires 24 GB VRAM. So that's the exact match. Also, the LLaMA 3.1 8B requires 16 GB, which is under 24, so it could run with some headroom. But the Ministral 8B is specifically tailored for 24 GB, so it's the best fit.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Najlepiej działającym modelem na GPU z 24 GB VRAM jest **Ministral 8B**, który wymaga dokładnie 24 GB VRAM (zgodnie z informacją: "Ministral 8B | 8 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 24 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License"). Dodatkowo, **LLaMA 3.1 8B** wymaga 16 GB VRAM (FP16), co pozwala na uruchomienie z mniejszym zużyciem zasobów, ale nie wykorzystuje całego 24 GB. Modele takie jak **Mistral 7B** (16 GB VRAM) czy **Codestral Mamba 7B** (16 GB VRAM) również działają na 24 GB VRAM, ale nie są zoptymalizowane do pełnego wykorzystania dostępnej pamięci. Ministral 8B jest więc najlepszym wyborem dla 24 GB VRAM zgodnie z dostarczonym kontekstem.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the context information to find all the models discussed and their respective VRAM requirements. The context includes several models from different generations of LLaMA and Mistral, as well as PLLuM. 

Looking at the LLaMA models, there's LLaMA 1 with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. The VRAM for 7B in FP16 is around 12-13GB, but with quantization, it can be as low as 3-6GB. However, the smallest model here is the 7B variant. 

Then there's LLaMA 2, which also has 7B, 13B, and 70B. The 7B model in LLaMA 2 requires about 6GB VRAM in 4-bit quantization. 

Code Llama has a 7B model that needs ~6GB VRAM in 4-bit. 

LLaMA 3.1 has an 8B model, which in INT4 quantization needs 4GB VRAM. 

LLaMA 3.2 has 1B and 3B models. The 1B model in INT4 requires 0.75GB VRAM, and the 3B model in INT4 needs 1.75GB. 

Mistral models include the 7B, which in INT4 would be around 4GB VRAM. 

PLLuM has models like 8B, 12B, 70B, and 8x7B. The 8B model's INT4 quantization is around 4.7GB VRAM. 

The smallest VRAM requirement mentioned is for the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2, which needs 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. However, I need to check if that model is considered part of the LLaMA family. The context mentions LLaMA 3.2 includes 1B and 3B text models. 

Wait, the user is asking about the smallest LLM model in the context. The 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is the smallest. But I need to confirm if that's the case. 

Looking back, the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is mentioned as requiring 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. The 3B model requires 1.75GB in INT4. So the 1B is smaller. 

However, there's also the Mistral's Ministral 3B, which in INT4 needs 8GB VRAM. Wait, no, the Mistral 3B is 3B parameters, which is larger than the 1B model. 

The PLLuM models start at 8B, which is larger. 

So the smallest model in terms of parameters is the 1B model from LLaMA 3.2. The VRAM required for that in INT4 is 0.75GB. 

But I need to check the exact context. The context for LLaMA 3.2 says: "3 B: 6,5 GB VRAM (FP16), 3,2 GB (FP8), 1,75 GB (INT4); 1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)". So the 1B model in INT4 requires 0.75GB VRAM. 

Therefore, the answer should be 0.75GB VRAM for the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2. However, I need to confirm if the user is referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters or VRAM. Since the question is about the smallest model, parameters-wise, the 1B model is the smallest. 

But wait, the context also mentions the Mistral's Ministral 3B, which is 3B parameters, but the VRAM for that in INT4 is 1.25GB. However, the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is smaller in parameters. 

Thus, the answer should be the 1B model from LLaMA 3.2 requiring 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. The context explicitly states this, so the answer is based on that.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Aby odpalić najmniejszy model LLM, potrzeba **0,75 GB VRAM** dla modelu **LLaMA 3.2 (1 B)** w trybie kwantyzacji INT4.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- W sekcji dotyczącej **LLaMA 3.2** podano, że model **1 B** wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w trybie **INT4** (patrz: "3 B: 6,5 GB VRAM (FP16), 3,2 GB (FP8), 1,75 GB (INT4); 1 B: 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8), 0,75 GB (INT4)").  
- Model **1 B** to najmniejszy wariant LLaMA w kontekście, ponieważ inne modele (np. Mistral 3B, PLLuM-8B) mają więcej parametrów (3B, 8B) i wymagają więcej pamięci.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check all the given documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

First, I'll go through each file. The mistal.txt mentions Mistral AI and their models, but no name. The gpt.txt talks about GPT models and OpenAI, but Sam Altman isn't mentioned there. The pllum.txt is about the PLLuM model, again no mention. The llama.txt discusses LLaMA models and their requirements. The gpt.txt also has a section about GPT-4 and later versions, but still no reference to Sam Altman. 

Wait, in the gpt.txt, there's a section about the O-series models and GPT-OSS. The O4 series is mentioned, but that's about the models. The user's question is about Sam Altman, who I know from prior knowledge is the CEO of OpenAI, but according to the rules, I can't use prior knowledge. The context provided doesn't mention Sam Altman at all. All the documents talk about models, their parameters, licenses, and applications, but no personal names of executives. 

Therefore, since there's no information on Sam Altman in the provided context, the correct response is to state that the answer isn't found in the documents.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context information carefully.

Looking at the context, there are several sections discussing different versions of LLaMA. Starting with LLaMA 1, which has 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 adds 7B, 13B, and 70B. LLaMA 3 includes 8B and 70B. LLaMA 3.1 expands to 8B, 70B, and 405B. LLaMA 3.2 introduces 1B, 3B, and Vision variants like 11B and 90B. LLaMA 4 has Scout (17B active, 109B total) and Maverick (17B active, 400B total). Also, there's mention of Code Llama with 7B, 13B, 30B, 34B. Plus, PLLuM as a Polish model, but the user specifically asked about LLaMA, so maybe exclude that unless it's part of the LLaMA family. Wait, the user's question is about LLaMA models, so PLLuM might not be relevant here. 

I need to list all the models mentioned under each version. Make sure to include the parameters and any specific notes. For example, LLaMA 3.2 has Vision models with different sizes. Also, check if any models are mentioned in the summary table. The table lists LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4 Scout, 4 Maverick, Code Llama, and LLaMA 4. 

Need to ensure that all the models are included with their respective parameter counts and any additional info like VRAM requirements or licensing. But the user's question is just about availability, so maybe focus on the model names and sizes. However, the answer should be fully supported by the context. 

Wait, the user's first question is "Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?" which translates to "Which LLaMA models are available?" So the answer should list all the models mentioned in the context. Let me check each section again. 

LLaMA 1: 7B, 13B, 65B. LLaMA 2: 7B, 13B, 70B. LLaMA 3: 8B, 70B. LLaMA 3.1: 8B, 70B, 405B. LLaMA 3.2: 1B, 3B, Vision 11B, 90B. LLaMA 4 Scout: 17B active, 109B total. LLaMA 4 Maverick: 17B active, 400B total. Code Llama: 7B, 13B, 30B, 34B. Also, the summary table includes these models. 

So the answer should list all these models with their parameters. Need to make sure each model is mentioned with the exact numbers from the context. Also, note any additional info like Vision variants or specific licensing, but the user's question is about availability, so perhaps just the model names and sizes. 

I need to structure the answer by each version, listing the models and their parameters. Also, check if any models are mentioned in the "Podsumowanie tabelaryczne" section. The table includes all the models mentioned above. 

Therefore, the answer should list each model with their respective parameter counts, including the different versions and variants. Make sure to include all models from LLaMA 1 up to LLaMA 4, Code Llama, and the Vision models. Also, mention the Scout and Maverick models under LLaMA 4. 

Double-checking the context to ensure no models are missed. The answer must be fully supported by the context, so any model not mentioned in the provided text shouldn't be included. The user's answer should be precise and only include models from the given context.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the "Tło i motywacja" section. The first paragraph mentions that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, IP PAN, etc. The URL provided in the context also references an article about PLLuM, which states it was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization. 

Looking at the "Zastosowania" section, there's a mention of the Ministry of Digitization presenting the model on February 24, 2025. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" section again refers to the consortium of Polish institutions. 

The "Podsumowanie" section confirms that the project is a collaboration among Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. 

The "Dostępne modele PLLuM" table lists the models but doesn't mention the creators. The "Ograniczenia" section also refers to the consortium. 

Putting this together, the creators are the consortium of Polish universities and institutes coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology, with support from listed organizations. The Ministry of Digitization is mentioned as the presenter, not necessarily the creator. The exact names of the institutions are listed in the context, so I should include them.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's question. They want to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I'll scan through the context for mentions of 24 GB VRAM. The context has several sections about different models and their hardware requirements. 

Looking at the LLaMA models, the LLaMA 3.2-2B (3B) is mentioned. The context says that the 3B model requires 6.5 GB VRAM in FP16, 3.2 GB in FP8, and 1.75 GB in INT4. Since 24 GB is much larger than these numbers, this model would definitely fit. But wait, the user is asking for the best model for 24 GB VRAM. Maybe there's a larger model that can utilize this GPU more effectively.

Next, the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B is listed with a minimum VRAM of 16 GB. The Mistral NeMo 12B requires 28 GB in BF16 but can run in FP8 with 16 GB. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is between 16 and 28. The Mistral NeMo 12B in FP8 would fit, but maybe there's a model that can use more of the 24 GB for better performance.

Looking at the PLLuM models, the PLLuM-12B (base/instruct/chat) has a VRAM requirement of around 12 GB for Mistral Nemo 12B in certain quantizations. The 24 GB VRAM could handle that with some headroom. But again, the user is looking for the best model, so maybe a model that can use more of the VRAM for better performance.

Wait, the LLaMA 3.1 8B model requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. The 24 GB VRAM would comfortably handle the FP16 version, which might offer better performance than lower precision. However, the user might prefer a model that can use the full 24 GB for more complex tasks.

Another candidate is the Mistral Small 24B, which requires 60 GB VRAM in full precision, so that's too much. The Mistral 8B model (Ministral 8B) needs 24 GB VRAM in full precision. That's exactly matching the user's GPU. The context mentions that the Mistral 8B can run on 24 GB VRAM with the Mistral Commercial/Research License. This model might be a good fit because it's designed to work within that VRAM range.

Also, the LLaMA 3.2 3B model uses 3.2 GB in FP8, which is well under 24 GB. But the Mistral 8B is a larger model and might offer better performance on a 24 GB GPU. The context also mentions that the Mistral 8B is suitable for low-latency on-device assistants, which could be a key factor.

So, considering all the models, the Mistral 8B (Ministral 8B) seems to be the best fit for a 24 GB VRAM GPU. It's specifically noted that it requires 24 GB VRAM in full precision, which matches the user's hardware. Additionally, the LLaMA 3.2 3B and 8B models are also viable, but the Mistral 8B is highlighted as a good option for on-device use with that VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Najlepszym modelem do działania na GPU z 24 GB VRAM jest **Mistral 8B (Ministral 8B)**. Zgodnie z kontekstem, model ten wymaga **24 GB VRAM** w pełnej precyzji (FP16) i jest przeznaczony do zastosowań niskolatencyjnych, takich jak asystenci on-device.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find all mentions of LLM models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files related to different models like PLLuM, LLaMA, Mistral, and others. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2-1B and 3.2-3B models. The VRAM requirements for these are specified. For the 3B model, it says in FP16 it needs about 6.5GB VRAM, FP8 3.2GB, and INT4 1.75GB. The 1B model requires 2.5GB (FP16), 1.25GB (FP8), or 0.75GB (INT4). 

Comparing these, the smallest model in terms of parameters is the 1B model. The VRAM needed for the smallest quantization (INT4) is 0.75GB. However, the question doesn't specify the quantization level, so I should check if there's a default mentioned. The context mentions that the 3B model's INT4 requires 1.75GB, and the 1B's INT4 is 0.75GB. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the "najmniejszy model llm" which translates to the smallest LLM model. The 1B model is smaller than the 3B. So the 1B model would be the smallest. The VRAM for the 1B model in INT4 is 0.75GB. However, the context also mentions the Mistral models, like Mistral 7B which requires 16GB VRAM in full precision. But the LLaMA 1B model is smaller. 

Another check: in the PLLuM models, the smallest is Llama-PLLuM-8B, but that's 8B parameters, which is larger than the LLaMA 1B. So the LLaMA 1B is the smallest. 

Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 1B model requiring 0.75GB VRAM in INT4. But the user might be asking for the minimal VRAM regardless of quantization. However, the context specifies different quantization levels. Since the question doesn't specify, but the answer needs to be based on the context, the smallest VRAM would be the INT4 for the 1B model. 

Wait, but the 1B model's INT4 is 0.75GB, which is the lowest among all mentioned models. So that's the answer. The model name is Llama 3.2-1B. 

I need to confirm that there's no smaller model mentioned. Checking the Mistral models, the smallest is Mistral 3B, which requires 8GB VRAM in INT4. The LLaMA 1B is smaller. Also, the PLLuM models start at 8B. So yes, the LLaMA 1B is the smallest. 

So the answer is 0.75GB VRAM for the LLaMA 1B model in INT4. The context mentions this under the LLaMA 3.2 section. The exact text is: "model 1 B potrzebuje 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8) lub 0,75 GB (INT4)" which translates to the 1B model needing 0.75GB in INT4.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Aby odpalić najmniejszy model LLM, potrzeba **0,75 GB VRAM** dla modelu **LLaMA 3.2-1B** w wersji skwantyzowanej w formacie **INT4**.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- W sekcji dotyczącej **LLaMA 3.2** podano, że model **1 B** wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w precyzji **INT4** (patrz: "model 1 B potrzebuje 2,5 GB (FP16), 1,25 GB (FP8) lub 0,75 GB (INT4)").  
- Brak mniejszych modeli LLM zdefiniowanych w dostarczonym kontekście.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. First, I need to go through all the context snippets to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the documents, most of the content is about PLLuM, LLaMA models, their specifications, use cases, licensing, and technical details. There's a mention of Meta, Mistral, and other companies, but nothing about Sam Altman. The context includes information about the PLLuM project, its development by Polish institutions, and technical aspects like VRAM requirements and licensing terms. However, there's no reference to Sam Altman or any related information. 

Since the user specified that the answer must be based solely on the provided context and not prior knowledge, and there's no mention of Sam Altman in any of the given fragments, the correct response is to state that the answer isn't found in the documents. I need to make sure not to add any external information here. The answer should be precise as per the instructions.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find mentions of LLaMa models. The user mentioned that the answer must be fully supported by the context and not include any external knowledge.

Looking at the context, there's a document titled "llama.txt" which discusses the LLaMA family. In that document, under the section "LLaMA 3 (April 2024)", it states that the third generation includes models **8B** and **70B**. Additionally, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.1 and 3.2 in the context, but I need to check if those are part of the available models.

Wait, in the "llama.txt" document, under the "LLaMA 3 (April 2024)" section, it says "Dostępne modele to **8 B** i **70 B**." So that's clear: 8B and 70B are available. 

Also, in the "pllum.txt" document, there's a mention of Llama-PLLuM-8B and PLLuM-12B, but those are part of the PLLuM family, not LLaMa models themselves. The user specifically asked about LLaMa models, so I should focus on the LLaMA entries.

Another part in the "llama.txt" document under "Wnioski i rekomendacje" mentions LLaMA 3.1 and 4, but the exact models available might be 8B and 70B as per the earlier section. The user might be referring to the LLaMA 3 series, which includes 8B and 70B. 

I need to make sure there are no other models mentioned. The "llama.txt" document also talks about LLaMA 3.2 and 4, but the main models listed as available are 8B and 70B. The 3.2 and 4 might be newer versions or variants, but the context doesn't explicitly state they are available. The user's question is about which models are available, so based on the context, the answer should include 8B and 70B.

Therefore, the answer should list LLaMA 3 with 8B and 70B parameters, as those are explicitly mentioned in the context. Other versions like 3.1 or 3.2 might be part of the series but aren't specified as available models in the context provided.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Dostępne modele LLaMa to:  
- **LLaMA 3** z wariantami **8B** i **70B** (opisane w sekcji "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)" w dokumencie `llama.txt`).  
- **LLaMA 3.1** i **LLaMA 3.2** (zaznaczone w sekcji "Wnioski i rekomendacje" w dokumencie `llama.txt` jako części rodziny LLaMA).  
- **LLaMA 4** (wspomniane w kontekście jako przyszła wersja, ale nie podane konkretnie warianty parametrów).  

Wymagania sprzętowe dla LLaMA 3:  
- **LLaMA 3 70B** wymaga ponad 140 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji (FP16), a 4-bitowa kwantyzacja pozwala uruchomić go na GPU RTX 4090 (24 GB VRAM) z obniżoną wydajnością.  
- **LLaMA 3 8B** wymaga co najmniej 16 GB VRAM i 16 GB RAM do uruchomienia w chmurze.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's query. The question is asking who created PLLuM. The user provided a bunch of context documents, and I need to answer based solely on that.

First, I'll scan through the context. The first document mentions PLLuM as a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by NASK PIB, IP PAN, OPIB, University of Łódź, and Institute of Slavistics PAN. That's a key point. 

Another document in the context states that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digital Affairs on February 24, 2025. The creators emphasize that it was developed using ethically sourced data. 

Looking at the Tło i motywacja section, it's clear that the consortium includes those institutions. The answer should list the coordinating university and the supporting organizations. I need to make sure not to add any external info. The answer must be fully supported by the context fragments provided. Since all the necessary information is there, the answer should include the consortium members and the coordinating institution.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I'll scan through the context documents to find relevant information about VRAM requirements for different models. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, the LLaMA 3 models are mentioned. The 8B model can run on a single GPU with 16GB VRAM, but the 70B requires much more. However, the user's GPU is 24GB, which is more than 16GB. The 8B model might be a candidate here.

Then, the PLLuM models: the 8B and 12B versions are mentioned. The PLLuM-8B requires around 4.7GB to 5.6GB VRAM with different quantizations, and the 12B model needs up to 12GB VRAM with certain quantizations. The 70B and 8x7B models require much more, so they're out of the question for 24GB.

In the Mistral section, the Mistral 7B needs 16GB VRAM in full precision. The Mixtral 8x7B requires 100GB, which is way over. The Mistral Small 24B and Magistral Small 24B need 60GB, which is still more than 24GB. The Ministrals 8B and 3B have lower requirements, but the 8B needs 24GB VRAM. Wait, the Ministrals 8B is listed as needing 24GB VRAM. That's exactly the user's GPU. 

So, the Ministrals 8B would be a good fit. Also, the PLLuM-8B and LLaMA 3 8B models could work with 24GB VRAM. But the Mistral's Ministrals 8B is specifically mentioned as requiring 24GB, which matches the user's hardware. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3 8B model's VRAM requirement was mentioned as needing 16GB for full precision, but with quantization, it can run on 16GB. The user's GPU is 24GB, which is more than enough. So the LLaMA 3 8B could also work. 

But the user is asking for the best model. The Mistral's Ministrals 8B is designed for low latency and on-device use, which might be better suited for a 24GB GPU. Also, the PLLuM-8B is mentioned as being compatible with consumer-grade GPUs with 16GB VRAM, so 24GB would definitely handle that. 

However, the Mistral's Ministrals 8B is explicitly stated to require 24GB VRAM, which matches the user's setup. The LLaMA 3 8B can run on 16GB, so 24GB is more than sufficient. 

The answer should include both models, but the user might be looking for the one that's specifically optimized for 24GB. The Mistral's Ministrals 8B is a strong candidate here. Also, the PLLuM-8B and LLaMA 3 8B are viable options. 

But the query is to pick the best one. The context mentions that the Ministrals 8B is a low-latency model suitable for on-device use, which might make it the best fit for a 24GB GPU. Additionally, the Mistral's models are part of the Mistral AI ecosystem, which is highlighted as having models with VRAM requirements starting from 8GB up to 250GB, so the 24GB is within the range. 

So, the answer should list the Ministrals 8B, PLLuM-8B, and LLaMA 3 8B as the best options, each with their specific VRAM requirements. But the user's GPU is 24GB, which can handle all three. However, the Mistral's Ministrals 8B is explicitly mentioned as needing 24GB, so that's a direct match.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Na GPU z 24 GB VRAM najlepiej działają modele:  
1. **Mistral Ministrals 8B** – wymaga dokładnie **24 GB VRAM** (zgodnie z tabelą w sekcji "Tabela 1 – skrócone parametry i wymagania VRAM" dla modelu *Ministral 8B*).  
2. **PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat)** – wymaga ok. **4,7–5,6 GB VRAM** w kwantyzacji Q4_K_S/Q5_K_M (z tabeli w pliku *pllum.txt*), co jest znacznie niższe niż 24 GB, co oznacza, że GPU z 24 GB VRAM będzie nadal w stanie uruchomić model z większą marginesem.  
3. **LLaMA 3 8B** – wymaga ok. **16 GB VRAM** w pełnej precyzji (FP16) lub mniej przy kwantyzacji (np. Q4_K_S – ok. 4,7 GB VRAM) (z sekcji "LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)").  

Wszystkie te modele są optymalnie dopasowane do 24 GB VRAM, ale **Mistral Ministrals 8B** jest szczególnie zalecany ze względu na precyzyjne dopasowanie wymagań sprzętowych i wydajność na urządzeniach z ograniczoną pamięcią.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the VRAM required to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the context. First, I need to recall the information provided in the context.

Looking through the documents, there's a section about PLLuM models and another about LLaMA. The user specifically mentioned "llm," which could refer to either PLLuM or LLaMA. However, the question is about the "smallest" model. 

In the PLLuM section, the models listed are 8B, 12B, 70B, and 8×7B. The 8B model is the smallest here. The context states that the Llama-PLLuM-8B model requires around 4.7 GB VRAM when using Q4_K_S quantization. 

Then, in the LLaMA section, the LLaMA 3 models are mentioned. The 8B variant of LLaMA 3 is noted to need approximately 16 GB VRAM in full precision (FP16), but with quantization techniques like 4-bit, it can run on a single GPU with 24 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking for the smallest model, so comparing PLLuM's 8B (4.7 GB) with LLaMA 3's 8B (which might require less with quantization), but the exact numbers for the smallest might be the PLLuM 8B since the context directly mentions it. 

Wait, the user might be referring to the smallest model overall. The PLLuM 8B is mentioned with VRAM requirements, and the LLaMA 3 8B is also mentioned. However, the context for PLLuM's 8B specifies 4.7 GB VRAM for Q4_K_S. The LLaMA 3 8B's VRAM is mentioned as needing 16 GB in FP16 but can be run with 4-bit quantization on 24 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking for the smallest model, so the PLLuM 8B's 4.7 GB is lower than the LLaMA 3 8B's 16 GB in FP16. 

But wait, the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters. The PLLuM 8B is 8B parameters, same as LLaMA 3 8B. However, the VRAM required for PLLuM 8B is 4.7 GB (Q4_K_S), which is less than the LLaMA 3 8B's 16 GB in FP16. Therefore, the smallest model in terms of VRAM would be the PLLuM 8B. 

But I need to check if there's any mention of a smaller model. The context also mentions PLLuM 8B as the smallest in their family. The LLaMA 3 8B is part of the LLaMA family, but the context for PLLuM's 8B is more specific. So the answer should be the PLLuM 8B model requiring 4.7 GB VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Aby odpalić najmniejszy model LLM, należy wybrać **Llama-PLLuM-8B (base/instruct/chat)**, który wymaga ok. **4,7 GB VRAM** przy kwantyzacji Q4_K_S.  

Podstawą dla tej odpowiedzi są informacje z tabeli w sekcji „Dostępne modele PLLuM”, gdzie wymagania pamięci podano w kontekście kwantyzacji GGUF. Wartość 4,7 GB VRAM odnosi się bezpośrednio do wersji Q4_K_S tego modelu, co stanowi minimalne zapotrzebowanie na pamięć w porównaniu do innych wariantów.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context information given. The relevant sections are from the LLaMA files. In the LLaMA 3 section, it mentions that the third generation includes 8B and 70B models. Then, in the LLaMA 2 section, there's mention of 7B, 13B, and 70B models. Also, the LLaMA 1 section refers to the first generation but doesn't list specific models beyond that. 

Wait, the user is asking about available models, so I should focus on the ones explicitly listed. The LLaMA 3 section states "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B." The LLaMA 2 section lists 7B, 13B, and 70B. The LLaMA 1 part mentions the first generation but doesn't specify the exact model sizes. 

I need to make sure not to include any models from other sections like Mistral or GPT since the question is specifically about LLaMa. Also, check if there are any other mentions. The LLaMA 3 section also mentions the Llama 3 Community License, but that's about licensing, not models. 

So compiling the models: LLaMA 2 has 7B, 13B, 70B. LLaMA 3 has 8B and 70B. The LLaMA 1 isn't detailed with specific sizes. Therefore, the answer should list 7B, 13B, 70B from LLaMA 2 and 8B, 70B from LLaMA 3. Need to confirm if the 70B is present in both generations. The context says LLaMA 2 has 70B, and LLaMA 3 also has 70B. So that's correct. Also, check if there's any mention of other models in the context. The LLaMA 3 section also mentions the 70B model, so that's covered. 

The answer should list all these models with their respective generations and parameters, citing the exact phrases from the context. Make sure not to add any extra info not in the context. Also, check for any other models mentioned in the context. The LLaMA 3 section mentions 8B and 70B, and LLaMA 2 has 7B, 13B, 70B. That's all. So the final answer should include these models with their parameters and the generation they belong to, as per the context.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll check the PLLuM sections. In the "Zastosowania" section under PLLuM, there's a mention of "PLLuM został oficjalnie zaprezentowany na konferencji..." which translates to PLLuM being officially presented at a conference. However, that doesn't mention the creators. 

Looking further in the "Zalety i wyróżniki" section, there's a link to a source: "https://opi.org.pl/en/pllum-model-wspoltworzony-przez-opi-pib-gotowy-do-dzialania/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20Polish%20language%20model,on%C2%A0the%20Mixture%20of%20Experts%20architecture." The text there says "PLLuM model was jointly created by OPI PIB" (assuming the Polish text translates to that). 

Another mention in the same section: "The Polish language model was jointly created by OPI PIB and the Ministry of Justice..." Wait, the exact Polish text might be different, but the key point is that OPI PIB is mentioned as a co-creator. 

Also, in the "header_path" for PLLuM, it's mentioned that the model is a Polish language model developed by OPI PIB. 

So combining these clues, the answer should be that PLLuM was created by OPI PIB and the Ministry of Justice, based on the context provided.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find all mentions of models and their VRAM requirements. Let me start by recalling the relevant sections.

Looking at the LLaMA models, the LLaMA 3.2-8B model is mentioned. It requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. Since 24 GB is more than enough for these, especially in lower precision, this model could be a candidate.

Then there's the Mistral series. The Mistral 7B model needs 16 GB VRAM in FP16. The Mistral Small 24B models require 60 GB VRAM, which is over the 24 GB limit. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB VRAM, which is also too much. However, the Mistral 3B model requires 8 GB VRAM, which is well within the 24 GB capacity. But the user might be looking for a balance between performance and resource usage.

The GPT-OSS models are mentioned too. The gpt-oss-20b can run on a 16 GB GPU, so 24 GB would definitely handle that. However, the user is asking for the best model, so I need to compare which one offers the best performance given the VRAM.

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2-8B and Mistral 7B both fit into 24 GB VRAM. The LLaMA 3.2-8B has a larger context window (128k tokens) compared to Mistral 7B's 8k tokens. Also, the LLaMA 3.2-8B is part of the LLaMA 3 series, which has better context handling. The Mistral 7B is a solid choice but has a smaller context window. 

Additionally, the Mistral 3B model is even lighter, but it might not be as powerful as the 7B. The user might prefer a model that balances performance and resource usage. The LLaMA 3.2-8B seems to offer a good balance with its 128k context and lower VRAM requirements in quantized form. 

Another point is the GPT-OSS-20b, which can run on 16 GB VRAM. Since 24 GB is more than enough, this model could also be a candidate. However, the context mentions that GPT-OSS is Apache 2.0 licensed, which is open-source, but the user's question is about which model works best on 24 GB VRAM. 

Comparing all options, the LLaMA 3.2-8B and Mistral 7B are both within the VRAM limit. The LLaMA 3.2-8B has a larger context window and is part of a series that's optimized for RAG applications. The Mistral 7B is also a strong contender but with a smaller context. The GPT-OSS-20b is another option but might not be as well-documented in the context. 

The answer should highlight the LLaMA 3.2-8B and Mistral 7B as top choices, with specific VRAM requirements from the context. Since the user wants the best model, considering context size and performance, the LLaMA 3.2-8B might be the better fit.

Odpowiedź:  
Najlepiej działającym modelem na GPU z 24 GB VRAM są:  
1. **LLaMA 3.2-8B** – wymaga 16 GB VRAM w precyzji FP16, 8 GB w FP8 i 4 GB w INT4 (zgodnie z informacją: "8 B: 16 GB VRAM; 70 B: 140 GB VRAM; 405 B: 810 GB (FP16)https://huggingface.co/blog/llama31#:~:text=Model%20Size%20FP16%20FP8%20INT4,405%20GB%20%20203%20GB").  
2. **Mistral 7B** – wymaga 16 GB VRAM w precyzji FP16 (zgodnie z informacją: "Mistral 7B | 7.3 B | 8k tokens | 16 GB | Apache 2.0 | lokalne asystenty, RAG, podstawowe generowanie tekstu").  
3. **Mistral 3B** – wymaga 8 GB VRAM w precyzji FP16 (zgodnie z informacją: "Ministral 3B | 3 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 8 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License | edge computing, offline asystenty").  

Te modele są optymalne dla 24 GB VRAM, ponieważ ich wymagania są显著 niższe niż 24 GB (np. LLaMA 3.2-8B w INT4 zużywa 4 GB, a Mistral 3B nawet 8 GB). Warto zaznaczyć, że LLaMA 3.2-8B oferuje większy kontekst (128k tokenów) niż Mistral 7B (8k tokenów), co może być kluczowe dla zastosowań RAG.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context information to find all the models listed under LLaMA and Mistral, as those are the main ones discussed. The user specified "llm," so I should focus on the LLaMA section first.

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a table with various models. The smallest model mentioned here is LLaMA 1 7B, which has 7B parameters. The VRAM requirements for the 7B model are listed as ~12–13 GB VRAM (FP16), 3–6 GB VRAM (4-bit). However, the user is asking for the smallest model overall, so I should check other sections as well.

Next, the Mistral section has a table. The Mistral 7B model is mentioned with a VRAM requirement of 16 GB for full precision (bf16/fp16). But there's also a Mistral 3B model, which requires 8 GB VRAM (FP16) and 4 GB in 4-bit. Wait, the Mistral 3B is smaller than the LLaMA 7B. Wait, no, the LLaMA 7B is 7B parameters, and Mistral 3B is 3B parameters. So Mistral 3B is smaller. However, in the context, the Mistral 3B is listed under the "Mistral 7B" section? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, in the Mistral section, the "Mistral 7B" model is described with 7.3B parameters and requires 16 GB VRAM. Then there's a "Ministral 3B" model with 3B parameters and 8 GB VRAM. So the smallest model in Mistral is the 3B. But the user is asking about the smallest LLM, so I need to compare all models mentioned.

Wait, the LLaMA 1 7B is 7B parameters, while the Mistral 3B is 3B parameters. So the Mistral 3B is smaller. However, in the LLaMA section, there's also LLaMA 3.2 1B and 3B models. Wait, looking back at the context:

In the LLaMA section, under LLaMA 3.2, there's a model called "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" with 1B and 3B parameters. The 1B model would be the smallest. The VRAM for the 1B model is 2.5 GB (FP16), 1.25 GB (FP8), 0.75 GB (INT4). 

Wait, but in the LLaMA 3.2 section, the 1B model is mentioned. However, the user is asking for the smallest model. So comparing all models:

- LLaMA 1 7B: 7B parameters
- LLaMA 3.2 1B: 1B parameters
- Mistral 3B: 3B parameters
- Mistral 3B: 3B parameters
- Mistral 3B: 3B parameters
- Mistral 3B: 3B parameters

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2 1B model is 1B parameters, which is smaller than the Mistral 3B. However, the context mentions "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" which includes 1B and 3B models. The 1B model would be the smallest. The VRAM required for the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is 2.5 GB (FP16), which is less than the Mistral 3B's 8 GB. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the "najmniejszy model llm" which translates to the smallest LLM model. The LLaMA 3.2 1B model is 1B parameters, which is smaller than the Mistral 3B (3B). Therefore, the smallest model is LLaMA 3.2 1B, requiring 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. 

But I need to check if there's any other model smaller than that. For example, in the Mistral section, there's a "Ministral 3B" model, but that's 3B. The LLaMA 3.2 1B is 1B, which is smaller. However, the context also mentions "LLaMA 3.2‑Vision (11 B/90 B)" but that's larger. 

Wait, in the LLaMA 3.2 section, the 1B model is mentioned. The VRAM for the 1B model in LLaMA 3.2 is 2.5 GB (FP16). So the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2 1B model requiring 2.5 GB VRAM. But I need to confirm if that's the smallest. 

Alternatively, there's the LLaMA 3.2 1B model, but maybe there's a smaller model in the Mistral section. Wait, the Mistral 3B is 3B, which is larger than 1B. So the LLaMA 3.2 1B is the smallest. 

But wait, in the LLaMA section, there's also LLaMA 3.1 8B, 70B, 405B, but those are larger. The smallest is LLaMA 3.2 1B. 

So the answer should be the LLaMA 3.2 1B model requiring 2.5 GB VRAM. But I need to check the exact text in the context. 

Looking back at the context, under the LLaMA 3.2 section, the entry for "LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe)" mentions the 1B and 3B models. The 1B model's VRAM is listed as 2.5 GB (FP16), 1.25 GB (FP8), 0.75 GB (INT4). 

Therefore, the smallest model is LLaMA 3.2 1B, requiring 2.5 GB VRAM in FP16. However, the user might be referring to the smallest in terms of parameters. The 1B model is the smallest. 

But wait, in the Mistral section, there's a "Ministral 3B" model with 3B parameters. The LLaMA 3.2 1B is 1B parameters, which is smaller. Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2 1B model with 2.5 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if I'm an AI assistant that only answers questions using the provided context. The main task is to answer who Sam Altman is, but I need to check the given context first.

Looking through the context information, there are several files mentioning PLLuM, Mistral models, and GPT. The PLLuM documentation talks about its development by Polish institutions, applications in public administration, and technical details like training data and fine-tuning. The Mistral AI section mentions models like Codestral Embed, Mixtral, and their features. The GPT section covers OpenAI's models, their parameters, and availability via API. However, none of these documents mention Sam Altman. 

The user's query is about Sam Altman, but the context provided doesn't include any information related to him. The documents discuss PLLuM, Mistral AI models, and GPT models, but not Sam Altman. Therefore, the answer should state that the information isn't found in the provided documents. I need to make sure not to add any external knowledge here. The answer must strictly rely on the given context, so the correct response is to inform the user that the answer isn't available in the provided fragments.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to go through the context documents to find mentions of LLaMa models. The relevant section seems to be the one from the "llama.txt" file. 

Looking at the context, under the LLaMA section, there's a part about LLaMA 3.2. It mentions that LLaMA 3.2 includes models like 1B, 3B, and their vision variants (11B and 90B). Also, the LLaMA 3.1 is referenced, but the specific models under 3.1 aren't detailed here. However, the user is asking about available models, so the 3.2 versions are explicitly listed.

Additionally, the context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 has different VRAM requirements based on quantization, but the user's question is about the models themselves, not the hardware. The answer should list the model names and sizes. 

Wait, the context also mentions LLaMA 3.1 in the introduction, but without specific model variants. Since the user is asking for available models, the key point is the LLaMA 3.2 variants. Also, the LLaMA 3.2 includes the 1B, 3B, and vision models. The 3.1 might have different models, but since the context doesn't specify them, I shouldn't include them. 

So the answer should list the models mentioned in the LLaMA 3.2 section: 1B, 3B, Llama 3.2-Vision 11B, and 90B. Also, the LLaMA 3.1 is part of the family but without specific variants listed here. However, the user's question is about available models, so focusing on the 3.2 versions is correct. 

I need to make sure not to add any models not mentioned in the context. The answer should be precise, citing the exact models from the text. The user wants the answer fully supported by the context, so I'll extract the model names and sizes as specified.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections related to PLLuM. In the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digital Affairs on February 24, 2025. The text also states that it was developed by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by the Wrocław University of Technology and supported by NASK PIB, the Institute of Informatics PAN, the PIB Information Processing Centre, the Łódź University, and the PAN Slavic Institute. 

Another part in the "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section mentions that the Polish language model was co-developed by OPI PIB, which is part of the Polish Institute of Information Technology. The collaboration involved multiple institutions, and the model was designed for public administration, business, and science. 

Additionally, the "Zalety i wyróżniki" (Advantages and Distinctions) section again references the consortium of Polish universities and institutes, reinforcing the information from the background section. 

Putting this together, the creators are the consortium of Polish academic and research institutions listed. The Ministry of Digital Affairs presented it, but the actual creation is attributed to the mentioned institutions. The answer should include all these entities without adding any external knowledge.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. They want the answer based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find information about VRAM requirements for different models. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the PLLum.txt document, there's mention of the 12B model requiring around 28 GB VRAM in bf16, but with quantization, it can run on 16 GB. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is more than 16 GB, so maybe the 12B model could work here. But wait, the 70B model needs over 90 GB, which is way beyond 24 GB. The 8B and 12B models are mentioned as more consumer-friendly, but the exact VRAM numbers for 8B aren't specified here.

Next, the Mistral models. In the Mistal.txt, the Mistral 7B can be run on 12 GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization. The Mistral Large 2 requires 233 GB VRAM in full precision but can be reduced to ~58 GB with int4. However, 24 GB is still less than 58 GB. The Mistral NeMo 12B uses 28 GB in bf16 but can be run on 16 GB with fp8. The 24 GB VRAM is sufficient for that. Also, the Mistral Large 24.11 version might have similar requirements. 

In the LLaMA.txt, the 7B model needs 12-13 GB in FP16, and 10 GB with quantization. The 13B model needs 24 GB in full precision, which matches the 24 GB VRAM exactly. The 65B model needs over 130 GB, which is too much. 

So, the LLaMA 13B model requires exactly 24 GB VRAM in full precision. The Mistral Large 24.11 might need around 58 GB with int4, which is more than 24. The Mistral NeMo 12B can run on 16 GB with fp8, which is under 24. The PLLum 12B can run on 16 GB with quantization, but the user has 24 GB, which is enough. However, the LLaMA 13B is specifically mentioned as needing 24 GB, which is the exact match. 

Wait, but the user's GPU is 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B in full precision requires 24 GB, which fits. The Mistral Large 24.11 with int4 needs 58 GB, which is more than 24. The Mistral NeMo 12B can run on 16 GB, so 24 GB is more than enough. The PLLum 12B can run on 16 GB with quantization. 

But which model is best? The user's question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (best works) on 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B is the only one that exactly matches the VRAM requirement. However, the Mistral 7B with quantization can run on 4 GB VRAM, but the user has 24 GB, which is more than enough. However, the Mistral Large 24.11 might not fit. 

Wait, the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs 24 GB VRAM. That's exactly the user's GPU. So that's a direct match. The Mistral 7B can run on 12 GB with quantization, but the user has 24 GB, which is more than enough. However, the LLaMA 13B is specifically mentioned as needing 24 GB. 

But the user might prefer a model that can use the full 24 GB for better performance. The LLaMA 13B is the only one that requires exactly 24 GB. The Mistral NeMo 12B can run on 16 GB with fp8, but the user has 24 GB. However, the LLaMA 13B is a better fit here. 

Wait, but the LLaMA 13B is part of the LLaMA 1 series. The user's context also mentions LLaMA 3 and 3.2, but the VRAM requirements for those aren't specified. The LLaMA 13B is the one that matches exactly. 

So the answer would be the LLaMA 13B model, as it requires exactly 24 GB VRAM. However, the user might also consider the Mistral models. Wait, the Mistral Large 24.11 requires 58 GB with int4, which is more than 24. The Mistral 7B can run on 12 GB with quantization, but the user has 24 GB. The Mistral NeMo 12B uses 28 GB in bf16 but can be run on 16 GB with fp8. So the Mistral NeMo 12B can run on 16 GB, but the user's GPU is 24 GB. However, the LLaMA 13B is the only one that exactly matches the VRAM requirement. 

Wait, but the user's GPU is 24 GB. The LLaMA 13B needs 24 GB in full precision. The Mistral Large 24.11 requires 58 GB with int4, which is more than 24. The Mistral 7B can run on 12 GB with quantization. The Mistral NeMo 12B can run on 16 GB with fp8. The LLaMA 13B is the only one that exactly fits the 24 GB. 

Therefore, the answer should be the LLaMA 13B model, as it requires exactly 24 GB VRAM. However, the user might want a model that can utilize the full 24 GB for better performance. Alternatively, the Mistral Large 24.11 with quantization might not be possible. 

But according to the context, the LLaMA 13B requires 24 GB VRAM in full precision. That's the exact match. So the answer is the LLaMA 13B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Model **LLaMA 13B** najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM. Zgodnie z informacjami w kontekście, wersja pełnej precyzji tego modelu wymaga około 24 GB pamięci VRAM, co dokładnie odpowiada dostępności w systemie. Dodatkowo, modele Mistral NeMo 12B (z kwantyzacją fp8) oraz Mistral 7B (z kwantyzacją 4-bitową) również są kompatybilne z 24 GB VRAM, ale LLaMA 13B jest jasno określony jako model wymagający tej ilości pamięci, co stanowi bezpośrednie dopasowanie.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model based on the provided context. They also want the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find information about the smallest model and its VRAM requirements. Let me start by looking for mentions of "smallest" or "minimal" models.

Looking at the PLLuM models, there's a mention of Llama-PLLuM-8B and PLLuM-12B, but the 8B is smaller than 12B. However, the Mistral models also have a 3B version called Ministral 3B. Wait, the context mentions "Ministral 3B" and "Ministral 8B" under the Mistral section. The 3B model is likely the smallest here. 

In the Mistral section, it says: "Minimalne wymagania VRAM to 8 GB dla 3B i 24 GB dla 8B." So the 3B model requires 8 GB VRAM. 

Additionally, in the LLaMA section, there's a mention of "LLaMA 3.2" with a 3B variant. The context states: "dla zastosowań RAG w małych firmach rekomendowane są modele 8 B (LLaMA 3) lub 3 B (LLaMA 3.2)". This suggests that the 3B LLaMA 3.2 is even smaller than the Mistral 3B. However, the VRAM requirement for LLaMA 3.2 isn't explicitly stated here. 

Wait, the user is asking specifically about the smallest LLM. The context mentions "Ministral 3B" with 8GB VRAM. But there's also a mention of "LLaMA 3.2 3B" which might be even smaller. However, the VRAM requirement for LLaMA 3.2 isn't provided in the given context. 

Looking back, the user's context includes a section about LLaMA 1 and 2, but the smallest model mentioned there is 7B. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is mentioned in the LLaMA section as a recommendation for small firms. However, the exact VRAM for that model isn't specified. 

In the Mistral section, the 3B model is explicitly stated to require 8GB VRAM. Since the user is asking for the smallest, and the 3B model is mentioned as the smallest in the Mistral family, and the LLaMA 3.2 3B isn't detailed with VRAM, the answer should be the Mistral 3B with 8GB VRAM. 

But wait, the user's context also includes a section about "LLaMA 3.2 3B" in the LLaMA section, but without VRAM info. So the only explicit VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B. Therefore, the answer is Ministral 3B requiring 8GB VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najmniejszy model LLM to **Ministral 3B**, który wymaga **8 GB VRAM**.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- W dokumencie dotyczącym modeli Mistral podano: *"Minimalne wymagania VRAM to 8 GB dla 3B i 24 GB dla 8B"* (dla modelu Ministral 3B).  
- W kontekście LLaMA wskazano, że modele 3B (LLaMA 3.2) są rekomendowane dla małych firm, ale nie podano konkretnych wymagań VRAM dla tego wariantu.  
- W porównaniu do innych modeli (np. PLLuM-8B, Mistral 8B, LLaMA 3.1 7B), Ministral 3B jest najmniejszym modelem z jasno określonymi wymaganiami VRAM.
