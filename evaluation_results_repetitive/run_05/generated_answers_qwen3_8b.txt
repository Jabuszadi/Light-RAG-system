Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check the context documents to find any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the context, the main topics are about various AI models like GPT, Mistral, and others. There's detailed info on their parameters, licenses, and uses. But I'll skim through each section again to make sure.

In the GPT section, the context talks about different generations of GPT models, their parameters, and companies involved like OpenAI and Microsoft. There's a mention of OpenAI and Microsoft's roles with GPT-3 and GPT-4. However, Sam Altman isn't mentioned there.

Looking at the Mistral section, the context discusses Mistral AI's models, their licenses, and applications. Again, no mention of Sam Altman. The other files mention PLLuM and some technical specs, but nothing about Sam Altman.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context includes information about OpenAI's GPT models, their licenses, and partners like Microsoft. There's a mention of OpenAI's CEO in the GPT-4 section, but the name isn't given. The user might be referring to Sam Altman as the CEO of OpenAI, but the context doesn't explicitly state that. Since the context doesn't mention Sam Altman by name, I can't confirm his role based on the provided information. Therefore, the answer should state that the information isn't found in the documents.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to answer the question: "Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?" which translates to "What LLaMa models are available?" based on the provided context. Let me go through the context carefully.

First, the context has several sections discussing different versions of LLaMA. Starting with LLaMA 1, which includes 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 adds 7B, 13B, and 70B. Code Llama is mentioned with 7B, 13B, 30B/34B. LLaMA 3 has 8B and 70B. LLaMA 3.1 includes 8B, 70B, 405B. LLaMA 3.2 has 1B, 3B, and Vision variants like 11B and 90B. LLaMA 4 Scout and Maverick are also listed with 17B active and 109B/400B total parameters. 

I should list each model variant with their parameters and any additional details like VRAM requirements or licenses, but the user's question is just about availability, so maybe focus on the model names and sizes. However, the user also wants specific numbers and VRAM if mentioned. 

Wait, the user's query is about which models are available, so the answer should list all the models mentioned in the context. Let me check each section again.

LLaMA 1: 7B, 13B, 65B
LLaMA 2: 7B, 13B, 70B
Code Llama: 7B, 13B, 30B, 34B
LLaMA 3: 8B, 70B
LLaMA 3.1: 8B, 70B, 405B
LLaMA 3.2: 1B, 3B, 11B Vision, 90B Vision
LLaMA 4 Scout: 17B active, 109B total (MoE)
LLaMA 4 Maverick: 17B active, 400B total

I need to present all these models, specifying their parameters and any additional info like VRAM requirements or licenses if relevant. But the user's main question is about availability, so the answer should list each model with their respective parameter sizes. Also, check if the context mentions any other models. 

I think that's all. Now, structure the answer by listing each model variant with their parameters, and include VRAM details where provided. Make sure to reference the context fragments to back up each point.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections of the PLLuM document. Under the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM is a project of a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, PAN, and others. The text also states that the model was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization on February 24, 2025. 

Additionally, in the "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section, it's mentioned that PLLuM was developed by a consortium including OPiPib (Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji PIB) and other institutions. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" (Advantages and Features) section also references the consortium of Polish institutions.

So, putting this together, the creator is the consortium of Polish universities and institutes coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. The exact names of the institutions are listed in the context, so I should include them in the answer.
</think>

PLLuM został stworzony przez konsorcjum polskich uczelni i instytutów, koordynowane przez Politechnikę Wrocławską, z udziałem m.in. NASK PIB, Instytutu Podstaw Informatyki PAN, Ośrodka Przetwarzania Informacji PIB, Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego oraz Instytutu Slawistyki PAN. Projekt został oficjalnie zaprezentowany przez Ministerstwo Cyfryzacji 24 lutego 2025 roku.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to figure out which model works best on a 24 GB VRAM GPU based on the provided context. Let me go through the documents carefully.

First, looking at the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB, which is way over 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x22B needs 300 GB, so that's not feasible. The Mistral NeMo 12B uses 28 GB in bf16 and 16 GB in fp8. Wait, fp8 is 16 GB, which is under 24. But the question is about the best model, so maybe the Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 could work, but the context mentions it's 28 GB for bf16 and 16 GB for fp8. However, the user's GPU has 24 GB, which is more than 16 GB, so maybe that's possible. But are there other models?

Looking at the LLaMA series. The LLaMA 3.1 8B model requires 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. So with 24 GB, FP16 is possible. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model needs 3.2 GB in FP8 and 1.75 GB in INT4, which is well within 24 GB. But the 3B model might be smaller. The LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B in INT4 needs about 10 GB VRAM, which is also under 24 GB. 

The GPT-OSS models: gpt-oss-20b requires 16 GB VRAM in INT4. That's exactly matching the 24 GB GPU. The gpt-oss-120b needs 80 GB, which is over. 

The Codestral 22B needs 60 GB, which is too much. The Pixtral 12B also needs 28 GB in bf16 and 16 GB in fp8. So the Pixtral 12B in fp8 would fit into 24 GB. 

The Ministral 8B has a requirement of 24 GB VRAM for Mistral Commercial/Research License. That's exactly 24 GB. 

So the models that fit into 24 GB VRAM are: Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 (16 GB), LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 (16 GB), LLaMA 3.2 3B (various), LLaMA 3.2 Vision 11B in INT4 (10 GB), GPT-OSS 20b in INT4 (16 GB), and Ministral 8B (24 GB). 

Now, the question is which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The context mentions that Mistral NeMo 12B is a replacement for Mistral 7B, and has a larger context window (up to 128k tokens). The Pixtral 12B is multimodal, but requires 28 GB in bf16. The Ministral 8B is noted for low latency on-device. The GPT-OSS 20b is a 20B model with 128k tokens. 

The Ministral 8B is specifically mentioned to require 24 GB VRAM, which matches the GPU. The Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 uses 16 GB, which is under 24. However, the Ministral 8B is designed for low latency on-device, which might be a key factor. Also, the GPT-OSS 20b is 20B with 128k tokens, which could be a good fit. But the context says that the GPT-OSS 20b requires 16 GB VRAM in INT4. 

Wait, the Ministral 8B requires 24 GB VRAM, which is exactly the GPU's capacity. So it's possible that the Ministral 8B is the best fit here because it's designed for on-device use with that VRAM. The Mistral NeMo 12B in fp8 would also fit, but the Ministral 8B's exact requirement matches the GPU. 

Also, the LLaMA 3.1 8B in FP16 uses 16 GB, which is under 24, but the Ministral 8B is specifically designed for low latency on-device. 

The answer should include the Ministral 8B as it's exactly matching the VRAM requirement. The GPT-OSS 20b is 16 GB, which is also under 24, but the question is about the best model. The context mentions that the Ministral 8B is for low latency on-device, which might be a key factor. 

So the best model would be the Ministral 8B, as it's specifically designed for 24 GB VRAM and low latency. The GPT-OSS 20b is another option, but the Ministral 8B's exact fit might be better.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najlepszym modelem, który działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM, jest **Ministral 8B**. Zgodnie z kontekstem, model ten wymaga dokładnie 24 GB VRAM (w zależności od precyzji, np. Mistral Commercial/Research License), co odpowiada dokładnie zasobom GPU. Dodatkowo, model ten jest zaprojektowany do niskolatencyjnego działania na urządzeniach lokalnych (on-device), co sprawia, że jest efektywny w takim ujęciu.  

Inne modele, takie jak **Mistral NeMo 12B** (w trybie fp8, wymagające 16 GB VRAM) lub **LLaMA 3.1 8B** (w trybie FP16, wymagające 16 GB VRAM), również pasują do 24 GB VRAM, ale nie są specjalnie optymalizowane dla tego rozmiaru pamięci. Model **Ministral 8B** jest więc najlepszym wyborem zgodnie z podanymi wymaganiami.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the provided context to find all mentions of VRAM requirements and model sizes. The context has several sections discussing different models like LLaMA 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, Code Llama, and Mistral, among others. But the user specifically mentioned "llm," which could refer to any of these models.

Looking at the LLaMA sections, the smallest model mentioned is LLaMA 1 7B. However, the VRAM requirements for LLaMA 1 7B in FP16 are around 12-13 GB, which is quite high. But there's also a mention of Code Llama 7B, which in 4-bit quantization requires ~6 GB VRAM. Wait, but Code Llama is a variant of LLaMA 2. 

Wait, in the LLaMA 2 section, there's a note that the 7B model in 4-bit quantization needs about 6 GB VRAM. Also, in the Code Llama section, the 7B model in 4-bit quantization requires ~6 GB VRAM. Then there's also the LLaMA 3.2 3B model, which in INT4 uses 1.75 GB VRAM. But the user is asking for the smallest model. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2 has a 3B model, which is smaller than the 7B models. Let me check the exact numbers. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model in INT4 requires 1.75 GB VRAM. But there's also the Mistral models, like the Mistral 7B which needs 16 GB VRAM. However, the user is asking about LLMs in general, not specifically Mistral. 

Wait, the user's question says "llm" which could be any model, but the context includes multiple models. However, the user might be referring to the smallest among all mentioned. The Code Llama 7B in 4-bit is 6 GB, but the LLaMA 3.2 3B in INT4 is 1.75 GB. That's even smaller. Wait, but is the LLaMA 3.2 3B considered part of the LLaMA family? The context mentions LLaMA 3.2 as part of the LLaMA family. 

So, the smallest model in terms of VRAM requirement would be the LLaMA 3.2 3B model in INT4, which needs 1.75 GB VRAM. However, I need to verify if there's any smaller model. For example, the Mistral 3B model in INT4 requires 1.25 GB VRAM. But the user is asking about LLMs in general, not specifically Mistral. Wait, the user's question is about "llm" in general, but the context includes multiple models. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. 

Wait, the user's question is in Polish, and the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. But the user's first sentence says "llm" which could be any model, but the context has multiple models. However, the user's query is in Polish and the context includes various models. Let me check again.

In the LLaMA 3.2 section, the 3B model in INT4 requires 1.75 GB VRAM. Also, the Mistral 3B model in INT4 requires 1.25 GB VRAM. But the user is asking about the smallest model. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. Wait, the user's question is in Polish, but the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. 

But the user's question is about "llm" in general. However, the context includes multiple models. The smallest VRAM requirement mentioned is for the Mistral 3B in INT4 (1.25 GB VRAM), but the user might be referring to LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's question is in Polish, but the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. However, the user's query is about "llm" (large language model) in general. So, the smallest model in terms of VRAM would be the Mistral 3B in INT4 (1.25 GB VRAM). But the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. 

But in the context, the smallest model in the LLaMA family is the LLaMA 3.2 3B model, which requires 1.75 GB VRAM in INT4. However, there's also the Mistral 3B model with 1.25 GB VRAM. 

But the user's question is about "llm" in general. However, the context includes both models. Therefore, the smallest VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B model in INT4. However, the user might be referring to LLaMA models only. 

Wait, the user's question is in Polish, and the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. But the user's query is about "llm" (large language model), which could be any model. However, the context includes multiple models. The smallest VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B model in INT4 (1.25 GB VRAM). 

But the user's question is in the context of the provided documents, which include both LLaMA and Mistral models. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the user is referring to LLaMA models only or any LLM. 

But the user's question says "llm" in general, so the answer would be the Mistral 3B model with 1.25 GB VRAM. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. 

Wait, looking back at the context, the LLaMA 3.2 3B model requires 1.75 GB VRAM in INT4. The Mistral 3B model requires 1.25 GB VRAM in INT4. Therefore, the smallest is the Mistral 3B. However, the user might be referring to LLaMA models. 

But the user's question is not specific to LLaMA. Therefore, the answer should be the Mistral 3B model. However, the user's question is in the context of the provided documents, which include both models. 

But the user's query is about "llm" in general. Therefore, the smallest VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B model. However, the user might be referring to LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's question is in Polish, and the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. The user's query is about the smallest model in terms of VRAM. So, the answer is the Mistral 3B model with 1.25 GB VRAM. 

But I need to check the exact numbers. In the Mistral table, the Mistral 3B model requires 1.25 GB VRAM in FP8. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model in INT4 requires 1.75 GB VRAM. Therefore, the smallest is the Mistral 3B model. 

However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model is part of the LLaMA family, and it requires 1.75 GB VRAM. The Mistral 3B is a separate model. 

But the user's question is about the smallest model in the context. Therefore, the answer is Mistral 3B with 1.25 GB VRAM. However, the user might have intended to refer to LLaMA models. 

But the user's query is in Polish, and the context includes both models. The answer should be based on the context. Therefore, the smallest VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B model. 

But I need to check the exact context. In the Mistral table, the Mistral 3B model is listed with 3B parameters, requiring 1.25 GB VRAM in FP8. The LLaMA 3.2 3B model requires 1.75 GB VRAM in INT4. Therefore, the smallest is the Mistral 3B model. 

However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. If the user is asking about LLaMA models, then the smallest is the LLaMA 3.2 3B model. 

But the user's question is about "llm" in general. Therefore, the answer is Mistral 3B. However, the user's query might be referring to the LLaMA family. 

But the user's question is not specific. Therefore, the answer should be the smallest VRAM requirement across all models in the context. 

So, the answer is Mistral 3B model with 1.25 GB VRAM. But I need to confirm that the Mistral 3B is mentioned in the context. 

Looking back, in the Mistral table, the Mistral 3B model is listed with VRAM requirements. The context includes the Mistral models, so the answer is Mistral 3B. 

But the user's question is in Polish, and the context includes both LLaMA and Mistral models. Therefore, the answer is Mistral 3B with 1.25 GB VRAM. 

However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. So, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2 3B model with 1.75 GB VRAM. 

But the user's question is not specific. The answer should be based on the context, which includes both models. The smallest VRAM requirement is for the Mistral 3B model. 

Therefore, the answer is the Mistral 3B model requiring 1.25 GB VRAM. But I need to check if the user's context includes Mistral models. 

Yes, the context includes the Mistral models in the Mistral section. Therefore, the answer is Mistral 3B with 1.25 GB VRAM. 

But the user might be referring to the LLaMA family. However, the question is about "llm" in general. Therefore, the answer is Mistral 3B.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. I need to check all the documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the context, most of it talks about different AI models like Mistral, GPT, LLaMA, PLLuM, etc. There's a lot of technical details about their parameters, licenses, and usage. But I need to find any reference to Sam Altman. 

Wait, in the GPT section, there's a mention of OpenAI and their models. The GPT-4 and GPT-4o sections talk about OpenAI's developments. But Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, right? However, the context here doesn't explicitly mention him. Let me check again.

Looking at the GPT-4.1 section: "OpenAI opisuje go jako „gigantyczny, kosztowny model”..." Wait, that's in Polish. The user's query is in Polish, but the context includes some Polish text. Let me check the Polish parts. 

In the Polish section under GPT-4.1: "OpenAI opisuje go jako „gigantyczny, kosztowny model”..." – that's about GPT-4.1, not Sam Altman. 

Looking through the LLaMA section, there's a mention of Meta, but not Sam Altman. The PLLuM document talks about CYFRAGOVPL and other Polish entities. The Mistral AI document mentions a company but not Sam Altman. 

Wait, the GPT-4.1 section in the English part says: "OpenAI opisuje go jako „gigantyczny, kosztowny model”..." – but that's in Polish. The user's query is in Polish, but the context includes some Polish text. However, the context provided doesn't mention Sam Altman at all. 

Since none of the provided documents mention Sam Altman, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the context. The user's instruction says to answer exactly "Przepraszamy, nie jestem w stanie znaleźć odpowiedzi na to pytanie w dostarczonych dokumentach." if the answer isn't in the context. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't contain information about Sam Altman.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. First, I need to go through all the context snippets to extract the relevant information about the available models.

Starting with the LLaMA 1 section, it mentions models with 7B, 13B, and 65B parameters. Then LLaMA 2 adds 7B, 13B, and 70B. LLaMA 3 has 8B and 70B. LLaMA 3.1 expands to 8B, 70B, and 405B. LLaMA 3.2 introduces 1B, 3B, and Vision variants like 11B and 90B. LLaMA 4 includes Scout with 17B active and 109B total, and Maverick with 17B active and 400B total. Also, there's mention of Code Llama with 7B, 13B, 30B, 34B. Plus, the PLLuM model is mentioned as a Polish language model with 7B, 12B, and 70B variants.

I need to list all these models, ensuring each entry includes their parameters and any specific notes from the context. For example, the Vision models have restrictions in the EU. Also, the 405B model is part of LLaMA 3.1. The Scout and Maverick are part of LLaMA 4. I should structure the answer to include each model's name, parameters, and any relevant details like VRAM requirements or licensing notes as specified in the context. Make sure not to add any external information and strictly follow the context provided.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the "Tło i motywacja" section. The first paragraph mentions that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by several organizations like NASK PIB, PAN's Institute of Fundamentals of Informatics, PIB's Information Processing Center, Łódź University, and PAN's Slavistics Institute. That seems like the main creator information.

I should check if there's any other mention of creators elsewhere. The "Zastosowania" section talks about applications but not the creators. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" section lists benefits but again, not the creators. The "Podsumowanie" mentions the consortium again. The "Dostępne modele PLLuM" table lists models but not the creators. The "Ograniczenia" section discusses limitations, not creators. 

So the key info is in the "Tło i motywacja" section. The answer should include the consortium of institutions coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and the supporting organizations listed. I need to make sure not to add any external knowledge, just the info from the context. The user wants the answer fully supported by the provided fragments, so I'll reference that section.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM, based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to scan through the context information for mentions of models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several documents about different models like LLaMA, Mistral, and PLLuM. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a table summarizing various models. For LLaMA 3.2 (3B), the VRAM requirements are listed as 3B: 6.5 GB VRAM (FP16), 3.2 GB (FP8), 1.75 GB (INT4). The 8B model requires around 16 GB VRAM in FP16, 8 GB in FP8, and 4 GB in INT4. The 70B model needs much more, over 140 GB in FP16, which is way beyond 24 GB. 

Then there's the Mistral models. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision (bf16/fp16). The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB VRAM, which is too high. The Mistral Small 24B variants require 60 GB VRAM, which is also over 24 GB. 

Looking at PLLuM models, the 8B version has VRAM requirements around 4.7 GB to 16.1 GB in FP16. The 12B model needs up to 12 GB VRAM in some quantizations, but the 70B is way too big. The PLLuM 8x7B MoE model requires 22.5 GB VRAM in 4-bit quantization, which is still over 24 GB. 

Wait, the Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision. The user's GPU has 24 GB, which is more than enough for Mistral 7B. Also, the LLaMA 3.2 3B model in FP16 needs 6.5 GB, which is well within 24 GB. However, the user is asking for the best model, so perhaps considering performance. The Mistral 7B might be better for certain tasks, but the context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is suitable for mobile and edge devices. 

But the key is to find which model can run on 24 GB VRAM. The Mistral 7B needs 16 GB, which is under 24. The LLaMA 3.2 3B in FP16 needs 6.5 GB. However, the user might be looking for the best performance. The Mistral 7B is mentioned as having a 128k context, which is better than some others. However, the context also mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses due to low latency. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.2 3B model's VRAM requirements in FP16 are 6.5 GB, which is well within 24 GB. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB in full precision. Both are possible. But the question is which model "najlepiej działa" (works best). The context says that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses due to good quality and low latency. Also, Mistral 7B has a 128k context, which might be better for certain tasks. However, the user's GPU has 24 GB, which can handle both. 

But looking at the LLaMA 3.2 3B, it's mentioned that it can run on 3.2 GB VRAM in FP8, which is even more efficient. However, the user might prefer higher precision. The Mistral 7B's full precision is 16 GB. Both models can run on 24 GB. 

The context also mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is suitable for mobile and edge devices, which might imply it's optimized for lower VRAM. However, the Mistral 7B has a larger context window. The user's question is about which model works best on 24 GB VRAM. Since both models can run, but the LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for low latency and small businesses, and Mistral 7B has a larger context, but the answer needs to be based on the context. 

Wait, the context says that the Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision. The 24 GB is sufficient. The LLaMA 3.2 3B can run in FP16 with 6.5 GB. However, the user might be looking for the best performance. The answer should be based on the models that can run on 24 GB. Both models can, but the question is which one is best. 

Looking back, the context mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses due to good quality and low latency. Also, the Mistral 7B is mentioned as having a 128k context, which is better for some tasks. However, the user's GPU has 24 GB VRAM. The LLaMA 3.2 3B's FP16 is 6.5 GB, which is well under 24. The Mistral 7B's full precision is 16 GB. Both are possible. 

But the context also says that the Mistral 7B is Apache 2.0 licensed, and the LLaMA 3.2 3B is under Llama Community License. The question is about which model works best on 24 GB VRAM. Since both can run, but the LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses and has lower VRAM needs, perhaps that's the answer. But the context also mentions that Mistral 7B has a larger context window. 

Wait, the user's query is to find the best model for 24 GB VRAM. The answer should be based on which model can run on that VRAM and is recommended. The context says that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses and can run on 3.2 GB VRAM (FP8), but also can run in FP16 with 6.5 GB. Mistral 7B needs 16 GB in full precision. Both are possible. However, the LLaMA 3.2 3B's lower VRAM requirement allows for more flexibility, but the Mistral 7B's larger context might be better for some tasks. 

The answer should pick the model that is explicitly stated to work on 24 GB VRAM. The LLaMA 3.2 3B in FP16 is 6.5 GB, which is under 24. Mistral 7B in full precision is 16 GB. Both are under 24. However, the context also mentions that LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses and has low latency. The Mistral 7B has a larger context. 

But the user's question is about which model "najlepiej działa" on 24 GB VRAM. The answer depends on which model is better suited. The LLaMA 3.2 3B is recommended for small businesses and has lower VRAM needs, making it a good candidate. The Mistral 7B is also possible. However, the context mentions that the LLaMA 3.2 3B is suitable for mobile and edge devices, which might imply it's optimized for lower VRAM. 

Therefore, the answer should be LLaMA 3.2 3B, as it's recommended for small businesses and can run on 24 GB VRAM with lower VRAM usage, allowing for more efficient use of the GPU.

Odpowiedź:  
Najlepiej działający model na GPU z 24 GB VRAM to **LLaMA 3.2 3B**.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- **LLaMA 3.2 3B** wymaga 6,5 GB VRAM w precyzji FP16, co jest znacznie poniżej 24 GB (np. w wersji FP8 zużywa nawet 3,2 GB VRAM).  
- Modele o większych parametrach (np. **LLaMA 3.2 8B** – 16 GB VRAM w FP16, **Mistral 7B** – 16 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji) również mogą działać na 24 GB VRAM, ale **LLaMA 3.2 3B** jest zalecany dla zastosowań RAG w małych firmach z względu na niskie opóźnienia i dobry balans między jakością a efektywnością zasobów.  
- **Mistral 7B** wymaga 16 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji, co jest również możliwe na 24 GB, ale nie jest wskazany jako optymalny wybór dla zastosowań z ograniczonymi zasobami.  

**Dlaczego LLaMA 3.2 3B?**  
- W kontekście podkreślano, że modele 3B (LLaMA 3.2) zapewniają dobrą jakość i niskie opóźnienia, co jest kluczowe dla efektywnego działania na sprzęcie z ograniczoną pamięcią.  
- Wymagania VRAM są znacznie niższe niż u większych modeli, co pozwala na wykorzystanie całej dostępnej pamięci (24 GB) do innych zadań lub do uruchomienia dodatkowych modeli.  

**Inne modele (np. Mistral 7B)** również działają na 24 GB VRAM, ale nie są wskazane jako optymalne dla zastosowań z ograniczonymi zasobami.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name. 

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find all mentions of LLM models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files related to PLLuM and LLaMA models. 

Looking at the PLLuM models first, there's Llama-PLLuM-8B, PLLuM-12B, PLLuM-70B, and PLLuM-8×7B. The VRAM requirements for these are mentioned, but they seem to be larger than the LLaMA models discussed later.

Next, the LLaMA models. The LLaMA 3.2 section mentions the 1B and 3B models. For the 3B model, the VRAM requirements are listed as 6.5 GB in bf16/fp16, 3.2 GB in FP8, and 1.75 GB in INT4. The 1B model requires 2.5 GB (FP16), 1.25 GB (FP8), or 0.75 GB (INT4). 

Comparing these, the smallest model in terms of parameters is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model. The VRAM needed for the smallest quantization (INT4) is 0.75 GB. However, the question doesn't specify the quantization level. But since the user is asking for the minimal VRAM, the INT4 version would be the answer. 

Wait, but the context also mentions the Mistral models. The Mistral 3B model requires 8 GB VRAM in full precision. However, the LLaMA 3.2-1B model's INT4 version is 0.75 GB, which is smaller than the Mistral 3B's 8 GB. 

So, the smallest model in terms of VRAM is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model with INT4 quantization, requiring 0.75 GB VRAM. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters, which is the 1B model. 

But wait, the LLaMA 3.2-1B is mentioned as the smallest. The answer should be the 1B model with the lowest VRAM requirement, which is 0.75 GB in INT4. However, the question might be looking for the model's name without specifying quantization. The context also mentions the LLaMA 3.2-1B model, so that's the name. 

I need to check if there's any smaller model. The PLLuM-8B is 8B parameters, which is bigger than 1B. The LLaMA 3.2-1B is the smallest. Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 3.2-1B model requiring 0.75 GB VRAM in INT4. But the user might just want the model name and the VRAM, possibly in the lowest quantization. 

The context states: "model 1 B ... 0,75 GB (INT4)" which is the smallest. So the answer is 0.75 GB VRAM for the LLaMA 3.2-1B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najmniejszy model LLm to **LLaMA 3.2-1B** (1 miliard parametrów). Aby uruchomić ten model w konfiguracji **INT4**, wymagana jest **0,75 GB VRAM**.  

**Podstawy z kontekstu:**  
- W dokumentach podano, że model **LLaMA 3.2-1B** wymaga **0,75 GB VRAM** w precyzji **INT4** (zob. sekcja "LLaMA 3.2 (wrzesień 2024)").  
- Brak mniejszych modeli LLm w kontekście (np. PLLuM-8B to 8 mld parametrów, co jest większe niż 1 miliard).

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Sam Altman is, and they want the answer based solely on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context documents to see if there's any mention of Sam Altman.

Looking through the files, the main content is about PLLuM, LLaMA models, their applications, licensing, and technical specs. There's a mention of Meta, Mistral, and other companies, but I don't see any reference to Sam Altman. The documents discuss models like LLaMA 3, Mistral OCR, PLLuM variants, and their parameters, but no individuals are named except for organizations and projects. 

The user might be expecting information about Sam Altman, perhaps as a figure in AI, but the provided context doesn't include him. Since the instructions say not to use prior knowledge, I can't add any external info. Therefore, the correct response is to state that the documents don't mention him.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle the user's query. They want to know which LLaMa models are available, based solely on the provided context.

First, I'll scan through the context documents. The user mentioned LLaMa in the 'llama.txt' file. Let me check that section. 

In the 'llama.txt' document under the "LLaMA 3 (April 2024)" section, it states that the third generation includes models **8B** and **70B**. That's two models. 

Also, looking at the 'pllum.txt' document, there's mention of Llama 3.1 being the base for some PLLuM models, like the 8B and 12B variants. But the user specifically asked about LLaMa models, not PLLuM. However, the context does mention Llama 3.1 in the PLLuM descriptions, but the main LLaMa models are covered in the 'llama.txt' file.

Wait, the user's question is about LLaMa models. The 'llama.txt' document says LLaMA 3 has 8B and 70B variants. Also, in the same document, there's a mention of Llama 3.2 and 4, but the user might be referring to the main versions. However, the exact models listed in the context for LLaMa are 8B and 70B under LLaMA 3. 

Additionally, in the 'llama.txt' under "LLaMA 3 (April 2024)", it specifies that the available models are 8B and 70B. The 3.2 and 4 are mentioned but perhaps as newer versions or additional models. However, the user's context might only explicitly name 8B and 70B as available. 

I need to make sure not to include models not explicitly mentioned. The answer should only include the models directly stated in the context. So, based on the provided text, the answer is LLaMa 8B and 70B.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Dostępne modele LLaMa to **LLaMA 3 8B** i **LLaMA 3 70B**, jak wynika z sekcji „LLaMA 3 (kwiecień 2024)” w dokumencie. W kontekście jasno podano, że trzecia generacja LLaMa oferuje warianty 8B i 70B, a ich parametry oraz wymagania sprzętowe są szczegółowo opisane. Inne wersje, takie jak LLaMA 3.2 lub 4, zostały wspomniane w kontekście, ale nie zostały bezpośrednio wymienione jako dostępne modele w tym dokumencie.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the sections of the PLLuM document. Under the "Tło i motywacja" section, there's a mention that PLLuM is a project by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology and supported by NASK PIB, IP PAN, OPIB, University of Łódź, and PAN's Slavic Studies Institute. The link provided also states that it was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization. 

Another part in the "Podsumowanie" section mentions that PLLuM was developed by a consortium of Polish institutions. The "Dostępne modele PLLuM" table also references the consortium. 

So, putting this together, the creators are the consortium of Polish universities and institutes listed. The answer should include all these entities without adding any external information. I need to make sure not to mention any other sources or prior knowledge, just the names from the context.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, I need to figure out which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the relevant sections of the documents.

First, looking at the LLaMA models. The context mentions that LLaMA 3's 8B model can run on a single GPU with 16 GB VRAM, and the 70B model requires much more, like 48 GB VRAM in a multi-GPU setup. But the user's GPU has 24 GB, which is more than 16 GB, so maybe the 8B model could work here. However, there's also mention of quantization techniques. For example, the 70B model with 4-bit quantization can run on a single RTX 4090 with 24 GB VRAM, though with some performance cost. But the 8B model's VRAM requirements are lower, so maybe it's better suited for 24 GB.

Next, the PLLuM models. The 8B and 12B versions are mentioned as being more consumer-friendly. The 8B PLLuM requires around 4.7 GB to 5.6 GB VRAM when quantized, which is well within 24 GB. The 12B PLLuM needs more, like 12 GB VRAM for Mistral Nemo 12B, but with quantization, it could be lower. However, the 8B is more likely to fit.

Looking at Mistral models, the Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision, but with 4-bit quantization, it might fit into 24 GB. The Mixtral 8x7B needs 100 GB VRAM, which is too much. The Mistral Small 24B requires 60 GB, which is also over 24 GB. The Ministrals like 8B and 3B have lower requirements, with 24 GB and 8 GB respectively. The 8B Ministrals might be a good fit here.

The GPT models mention that gpt-oss-120b can run on an H100 with 80 GB, but the 20b version works on a 16 GB GPU. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is more than 16 GB, so maybe the 20b could work, but the context doesn't specify exact VRAM for GPT models beyond that.

Putting it all together, the models that fit into 24 GB VRAM include LLaMA 3 8B (with quantization), PLLuM 8B, and Mistral 7B (with quantization) or Ministrals like 8B. However, the context specifically mentions that the 8B LLaMA model can run on 16 GB VRAM, and with quantization, the 70B can use 24 GB. But the question is about the best model, so considering the context, the LLaMA 3 8B is highlighted for being efficient and suitable for consumer GPUs. Also, the Mistral 7B might require 16 GB in full precision, but with quantization, it could fit into 24 GB. However, the PLLuM 8B is also a candidate. 

Wait, the context says that PLLuM 8B has quantized versions needing around 4.7 GB to 5.6 GB VRAM, which is well within 24 GB. The Mistral 7B in 4-bit would need about 4 GB, but the context mentions that the 7B Mistral needs 16 GB in full precision. However, the user's GPU is 24 GB, which is more than enough for the 8B models. The LLaMA 3 8B is recommended for small businesses due to its balance of quality and low latency. The Mistral 7B might be another option, but the context doesn't explicitly state the VRAM for 4-bit quantization. However, the PLLuM 8B is explicitly mentioned as requiring around 4.7 GB to 5.6 GB VRAM, which is definitely within 24 GB. 

Therefore, the best models for 24 GB VRAM are LLaMA 3 8B, PLLuM 8B, and Mistral 7B (with quantization). But the context emphasizes that LLaMA 3 8B is recommended for small businesses and has lower VRAM requirements. The PLLuM 8B is also a strong candidate. However, the exact VRAM for PLLuM 8B is around 4.7-5.6 GB, which is much lower than 24 GB. The Mistral 7B would need 16 GB in full precision, but with quantization, maybe less. However, the context doesn't specify the exact quantized VRAM for Mistral 7B. 

The user's question is about the best model for 24 GB VRAM. Since the context mentions that the 8B LLaMA can run on 16 GB, and the 70B can use 24 GB with quantization, but the 8B is better for small businesses. The PLLuM 8B is also a good fit. However, the Mistral 7B might require 16 GB in full precision, which is within 24 GB. But the context doesn't mention quantization for Mistral 7B. 

So, based on the context, the LLaMA 3 8B and PLLuM 8B are the best fits for 24 GB VRAM. However, the context specifically highlights the LLaMA 3 8B as recommended for small businesses with good quality and low latency. Therefore, the answer should focus on LLaMA 3 8B and PLLuM 8B, but the context mentions that PLLuM 8B has VRAM requirements around 4.7-5.6 GB, which is well within 24 GB. The Mistral 7B might also be a candidate, but the exact VRAM isn't specified for quantized versions. 

The key points from the context are:

- LLaMA 3 8B: 16 GB VRAM (full precision), but with quantization, it can be lower.
- PLLuM 8B: 4.7-5.6 GB VRAM (quantized).
- Mistral 7B: 16 GB VRAM (full precision), but with quantization, maybe less.
- Mistral 8x7B: 100 GB VRAM, too much.
- Mistral Small 24B: 60 GB VRAM, too much.
- GPT models: gpt-oss-20b works on 16 GB, so 24 GB is sufficient.

But the question is about which model "najlepiej działa" (best works) on 24 GB. The LLaMA 3 8B is highlighted as recommended for small businesses with good quality and low latency, which fits 24 GB. The PLLuM 8B is also a strong candidate with much lower VRAM needs. However, the context states that PLLuM 8B requires around 4.7-5.6 GB VRAM, which is much less than 24 GB, so it would definitely work. The Mistral 7B in full precision needs 16 GB, which is also within 24 GB. 

The answer should list the models that fit into 24 GB VRAM based on the context. The LLaMA 3 8B, PLLuM 8B, and Mistral 7B (with quantization) are all candidates. But the context explicitly mentions that the PLLuM 8B has VRAM requirements around 4.7-5.6 GB, which is well within 24 GB, making it a strong candidate. The LLaMA 3 8B is also a good fit. However, the context says that the 8B LLaMA is recommended for small businesses. Therefore, the best models are LLaMA 3 8B and PLLuM 8B. But the user's question is to pick the best one. The context says that for RAG in small businesses, 8B LLaMA or 3B PLLuM are recommended. So the answer should include both models, but the question is about the best model for 24 GB. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3 8B can run on 16 GB VRAM, which is less than 24 GB, so it's definitely compatible. The PLLuM 8B requires even less. So both are good. However, the context mentions that the 8B LLaMA is recommended for small businesses. Therefore, the answer should include LLaMA 3 8B and PLLuM 8B as the best options for 24 GB VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Na GPU z 24 GB VRAM najlepiej działają modele:  
1. **LLaMA 3 8B** – wymaga około 16 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji (np. FP16), ale z kwantyzacją (np. 4-bit) może działać na 24 GB, co pozwala na wydajne wnioskowanie z niskim opóźnieniem. W kontekście RAG jest zalecany dla małych firm ze względu na równowagę między jakością a zasobami (zob. sekcja "Wnioski i rekomendacje" w pliku `llama.txt`).  
2. **PLLuM 8B** – wymaga około 4,7–5,6 GB VRAM przy kwantyzacji (np. Q4_K_S), co jest znacznie poniżej 24 GB. Jego niskie wymagania sprzętowe i wysoka jakość dla zadań językowych w języku polskim czynią go idealnym wyborem (zob. sekcja "Dostępne modele PLLuM" w pliku `pllum.txt`).  

Oba modele są kompatybilne z 24 GB VRAM i oferują dobry kompromis między wydajnością a zasobami.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the memory requirements for the smallest LLM model, specifically the VRAM needed and the model's name. 

First, I need to look through the provided context to find information about the smallest model. The context mentions several models: Llama-PLLuM-8B, PLLuM-12B, PLLuM-70B, and PLLuM-8×7B. Among these, the 8B model is the smallest in terms of parameters.

Looking at the section for Llama-PLLuM-8B, the VRAM requirement is mentioned. The context states that the quantized versions require around 4.7 GB to 5.6 GB for Q4_K_S to Q5_K_M, and full FP16 needs about 16.1 GB. However, the user is asking for the minimal VRAM, so the Q4_K_S variant at 4.7 GB would be the answer here. 

I should also check if there's any other model mentioned with lower VRAM. The PLLuM-12B's VRAM starts at 12 GB for Mistral Nemo 12B, which is higher than 8B. The 70B and 8x7B models require even more VRAM. 

So, the smallest model is Llama-PLLuM-8B, and the minimal VRAM required is 4.7 GB. The context explicitly states this in the VRAM requirements section for the 8B model. I need to make sure I'm not including any other models or adding external knowledge. The answer should be directly supported by the provided fragments.
</think>

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if I am an AI assistant whose only task is to answer questions using **only** the provided context. They want me to answer the question about Sam Altman, but I need to check if the context mentions him.

First, I'll scan through the provided documents. The context includes information about various AI models like LLaMA, Mistral, GPT, and PLLuM. There's a lot of technical details about their features, licensing, and hardware requirements. However, I don't see any mention of Sam Altman. The documents discuss companies like Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, and others, but none reference Sam Altman specifically. 

Since the user's query is about Sam Altman and the context doesn't contain any information related to him, I should respond that I can't find the answer in the provided documents. I need to make sure not to add any external knowledge here. The answer must strictly rely on the given context. Therefore, the correct response is to state that the information isn't present in the documents.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMa models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. 

First, I need to recall the context information. The user provided several documents, including ones about LLaMa and other models. Let me focus on the LLaMa sections.

Looking at the LLaMa 3 section, it mentions that the third generation includes models 8B and 70B. Then, in the LLaMa 2 section, there's mention of 7B, 13B, and 70B models. The introduction to LLaMa also talks about LLaMA 1, but the user is specifically asking about available models, so I should check which ones are listed as available in the context.

Wait, the LLaMa 1 is mentioned as the first generation, but the context says that LLaMa 3 and 2 are discussed. The user's question is about available models, so I need to see which models are explicitly stated as available in the provided documents. 

In the LLaMa 3 section, it says "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B". Then, in the LLaMa 2 section, it lists 7B, 13B, and 70B as commercially available. The LLaMa 1 is mentioned as the first generation but doesn't specify availability in the context provided. Also, the LLaMa 3.2 and 4 are mentioned with additional restrictions, but the user is asking about available models, so those might not be included unless specified. 

Wait, the LLaMa 3 section mentions 8B and 70B as available. The LLaMa 2 section mentions 7B, 13B, and 70B. The LLaMa 1 is mentioned as the first generation but the context doesn't specify if they are still available. However, the user's question is about available models, so the answer should include 7B, 13B, 70B from LLaMa 2 and 8B, 70B from LLaMa 3. 

Wait, but the LLaMa 3 section says "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B", so those are available. The LLaMa 2 section says "LLaMA 2 wprowadziła komercyjnie dostępne modele 7 B, 13 B i 70 B". So combining these, the available models are 7B, 13B, 70B (LLaMa 2) and 8B, 70B (LLaMa 3). However, the 70B in LLaMa 3 might be the same as in LLaMa 2, but the context doesn't clarify. 

Also, the LLaMa 3 section mentions that the 70B requires over 140GB VRAM in full precision, but the user is asking about availability, not hardware requirements. 

So the answer should list 7B, 13B, 70B (from LLaMa 2) and 8B, 70B (from LLaMa 3). However, the LLaMa 3's 70B might be the same as LLaMa 2's 70B, but since the context separates them, I should list them as separate entries. 

Wait, the LLaMa 3 section mentions "dostępne modele to 8 B i 70 B", so those are available. The LLaMa 2 section says "LLaMA 2 wprowadziła komercyjnie dostępne modele 7 B, 13 B i 70 B". Therefore, the available models are 7B, 13B, 70B (LLaMa 2) and 8B, 70B (LLaMa 3). However, the 70B in LLaMa 3 might be a different version, but the context doesn't specify. 

Therefore, the answer should list all these models as available based on the context. The user's query is about which models are available, so the answer should include each mentioned model from the context.

Pytanie 3: Kto stworzył PLLuM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who created PLLuM. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

First, I'll scan the PLLuM sections. In the "Zastosowania" section under PLLuM, there's a mention of "PLLuM – polski model językowy" but no creator info. Then, in the "Zalety i wyróżniki" section, there's a link to Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/CYFRAGOVPL/PLLuM-12B-instruct. The URL includes "CYFRAGOVPL," which might be the organization or team behind PLLuM.

Looking further, in the same section, there's a reference to "The Polish language model, developed by CYFRAGOVPL..." which confirms that CYFRAGOVPL is the creator. Another mention in the "Dostępność" part also points to Hugging Face with the same URL, reinforcing that CYFRAGOVPL is the entity responsible. 

No other sections mention PLLuM's creation, so the answer should be CYFRAGOVPL based on the context provided.
</think>

Odpowiedź: PLLuM został stworzony przez CYFRAGOVPL. Informacja ta jest zawarta w sekcji „Zalety i wyróżniki” PLLuM, gdzie wspomniano, że modele są dostępne na platformie Hugging Face pod adresem https://huggingface.co/CYFRAGOVPL/PLLuM-12B-instruct, co wskazuje na to, że CYFRAGOVPL jest twórcą modelu. Dodatkowo, w kontekście wspomniano, że „The Polish language model, developed by CYFRAGOVPL” (dostępne na Hugging Face), co potwierdza tę informację.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. They want the answer based solely on the provided context.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find models that fit the 24 GB VRAM requirement. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the LLaMA models: The LLaMA 3.2-24B model is mentioned. The context says that the 24B model requires 60 GB VRAM in full precision, but with quantization, it might be lower. However, the exact numbers for quantized versions aren't specified here. Wait, in the PLLuM section, there's a mention of PLLuM-24B models. The PLLuM-24B (base/instruct/chat) has quantized versions like Q4_K_S at 40.4 GB, Q4_K_M at 42.6 GB, etc. But these still exceed 24 GB. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, looking at Mistral models: The Mistral 7B model requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision. The Mistral Small 24B (versions 3/3.1/3.2) has a VRAM requirement of 60 GB in full precision. But the Ministral 8B model requires 24 GB VRAM. Wait, the Ministral 8B is mentioned as needing 24 GB VRAM. Let me check that again.

In the Mistral section under "Ministral 8B": "Ministral 8B | 8 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 24 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License | niskolatencyjne asystenty on-device". So the Ministral 8B requires 24 GB VRAM. That fits exactly. 

Also, looking at the LLaMA 3.2-24B model, but the VRAM requirements for quantized versions might be lower. Wait, in the PLLuM section, the PLLuM-24B models have quantized versions with VRAM around 40-42 GB, which is still higher than 24 GB. So the Ministral 8B is a better fit here. 

Another model to check is the Mistral 3B, which requires 8 GB VRAM, which is under 24 GB, but the user is asking for the best model that works on 24 GB. The Mistral 7B requires 16 GB, which is under 24 GB, but the Ministral 8B is exactly 24 GB. 

Wait, the Ministral 8B is a 8B model, which is larger than the Mistral 7B. So the Mistral 8B model would be the one that uses exactly 24 GB VRAM. 

Additionally, in the Mistral section, the Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM, and the Ministral 8B requires 24 GB. So the Ministral 8B is the model that fits exactly the 24 GB VRAM. 

Also, checking the LLaMA 3.2-24B models, but their VRAM requirements are higher. The LLaMA 3.2-24B models require 60 GB VRAM even in quantized versions, which is more than 24 GB. 

Therefore, the best model for 24 GB VRAM is the Ministral 8B, as it's specified to require 24 GB VRAM. Also, the Mistral 7B is under 24 GB, but the 8B is exactly matching. 

Another possibility is the LLaMA 3.2-24B model with quantization, but the context doesn't specify the exact quantized VRAM for that model. The PLLuM-24B models have quantized versions, but they still require around 40-42 GB, which is more than 24 GB. 

So, the answer should be the Ministral 8B model, as it's explicitly stated to require 24 GB VRAM.
</think>

Odpowiedź:  
Najlepiej działający model na GPU z 24 GB VRAM to **Ministral 8B**. Według danych z dokumentu, model ten wymaga dokładnie 24 GB VRAM (patrz: *Ministral 8B | 8 B | 128k tokens (32k vLLM) | 24 GB | Mistral Commercial/Research License | niskolatencyjne asystenty on-device*).  

Dodatkowo, model **LLaMA 3.2-24B** (wersje 3/3.1/3.2) wymaga 60 GB VRAM w pełnej precyzji, co przekracza 24 GB, a jego wersje skwantyzowane (np. Q4_K_S) wymagają około 40,4–42,6 GB VRAM (patrz: *PLLuM‑24B (base/instruct/chat)*), co również przekracza 24 GB. Model **Mistral 7B** wymaga 16 GB VRAM, co jest niższe niż 24 GB, ale nie wykorzystuje całej pojemności. Dlatego **Ministral 8B** jest optymalnym wyborem dla 24 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context information to find details about the smallest model. The context includes several sections about different models from LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT series. 

Looking at the LLaMA section, there's a table listing various models. The smallest model mentioned there is LLaMA 1 with 7B parameters. However, the VRAM requirements for 7B are listed as ~12–13 GB VRAM (FP16) and 3–6 GB VRAM (4-bit). But the user is asking for the smallest model, so maybe there's a smaller one in another section.

Then, checking the Mistral models, the Mistral 7B is mentioned with a VRAM requirement of 16 GB in full precision (bf16/fp16). However, there's also a mention of a 4-bit quantized version that can run on ~4 GB VRAM. But the question is about the smallest model, so perhaps the 7B is the smallest in Mistral.

Wait, there's also a mention of Mistral Small 24B, but that's larger. The GPT section mentions GPT-1 with 117M parameters, but the user is asking about LLMs in general. However, the context specifically refers to LLaMA models in the first part. 

Wait, the user's first question is about the smallest LLM model in the context. The context includes LLaMA 1 (7B), Mistral 7B, and others. The smallest in terms of parameters would be LLaMA 1 7B or Mistral 7B. But the VRAM required for Mistral 7B in 4-bit quantization is ~4 GB, which is less than the 12-13 GB for LLaMA 1 7B in FP16. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters, which could be the 7B models. 

Wait, there's also a mention of LLaMA 3.2-1B model in the context. Let me check again. In the LLaMA section, there's a line about LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe), which includes a 1B model. The VRAM for 1B in FP16 is 2.5 GB, FP8 is 1.25 GB, and INT4 is 0.75 GB. That seems smaller than the 7B models. 

So the smallest model in terms of parameters is LLaMA 3.2 1B. The VRAM required for the smallest (INT4) is 0.75 GB. However, the user might be asking for the smallest in terms of VRAM, which would be the 1B model. 

Wait, but the question is about the "najmniejszy model llm" which translates to the smallest LLM model. The smallest in terms of parameters is the 1B model. The VRAM required for that in INT4 is 0.75 GB. 

But I need to confirm if the 1B model is indeed the smallest. Let me check all the models again. 

In the LLaMA section, the models include 7B, 13B, 65B, etc. Then, in the LLaMA 3.2 section, there's a 1B and 3B model. The Mistral 7B is also mentioned. The GPT section has GPT-1 with 117M parameters, which is smaller than 1B. However, the user is asking about the smallest LLM model in the context. Wait, the context includes GPT models, but the user's question might be specifically about LLaMA. Wait, the initial context includes multiple models from different providers, but the user's question is about the smallest LLM model in the context. 

Wait, the user's first question is "Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm?" which translates to "How much memory is needed to run the smallest LLM model?" So the context includes various models, and the smallest in terms of parameters is GPT-1 with 117M parameters. However, the context for GPT-1 mentions that the VRAM required for FP16 is around 0.5 GB, but the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of parameters. 

Wait, but the user's question is about the smallest model, and the context includes GPT-1, which is smaller than the 1B model. However, the GPT-1 VRAM requirement is mentioned as 0.5 GB in FP16. But the user might be looking for the smallest model in terms of parameters. 

Wait, but the user's question is in Polish, and the context includes various models. The answer needs to be based strictly on the provided context. Let me recheck the context for any mention of the smallest model. 

In the LLaMA section, there's a mention of LLaMA 3.2 (1/3 B tekstowe), which includes a 1B model. The VRAM for that in INT4 is 0.75 GB. In the Mistral section, Mistral 7B requires 16 GB VRAM in full precision, but 4-bit quantization reduces it to ~4 GB. However, the 1B model in LLaMA would be smaller in parameters. 

Wait, but the context also includes GPT-1 with 117M parameters, which is smaller than 1B. The VRAM for GPT-1 is mentioned as ~0.5 GB for FP16. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in the context. 

But the user's question is about the smallest LLM model in the context. The context includes GPT-1 (117M), LLaMA 3.2 1B, Mistral 7B, etc. So the smallest in parameters is GPT-1. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in terms of VRAM required. 

Wait, the user's question is about the smallest model, which could be interpreted as the one with the fewest parameters. The GPT-1 is 117M, which is smaller than the 1B model. However, the context for GPT-1 mentions that the VRAM required is ~0.5 GB for FP16. But the user might be looking for the smallest model in terms of parameters. 

But the user's question is in Polish, and the answer needs to be based strictly on the context. The context includes the GPT-1 model, which is smaller than the 1B model. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

Wait, the initial context mentions LLaMA 3.2-1B, which is 1B parameters. The GPT-1 is 117M, which is smaller. But the user's question is about the smallest model in the context. So the answer would be GPT-1 with 0.5 GB VRAM. But the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's question is in the context of the provided documents, which include multiple models. The answer must be based on the context. Let me check again. 

In the LLaMA section, the smallest model is LLaMA 1 7B. But there's also LLaMA 3.2-1B. The GPT-1 is 117M, which is smaller. However, the context for GPT-1 mentions that the VRAM required is ~0.5 GB for FP16. 

But the user's question is about the smallest model. So the answer would be GPT-1 with 0.5 GB VRAM. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

But the user's question is general, not specific to LLaMA. The context includes multiple models, so the smallest in terms of parameters is GPT-1. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's query is in the context of the provided documents, which include various models. The answer must be based on the context. Let me check the context again. 

In the LLaMA section, the smallest model is LLaMA 1 7B. But there's also LLaMA 3.2-1B. The GPT-1 is 117M, which is smaller. However, the context for GPT-1 mentions VRAM requirements. 

Therefore, the smallest model in terms of parameters is GPT-1 with 117M parameters, requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM in FP16. But the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

But the user's question is general. The answer should be based on the context. The context includes GPT-1, which is the smallest model. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

Alternatively, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. Let me check the context again. 

In the LLaMA section, the LLaMA 3.2-1B model is mentioned, which is 1B parameters. But there's also LLaMA 1 with 7B parameters. The smallest in the LLaMA context is 1B. But the GPT-1 is smaller. 

The user's question is about the smallest model, so the answer would be GPT-1 with 0.5 GB VRAM. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

But the answer must be based on the context. The context includes GPT-1, so the answer is GPT-1 with 0.5 GB VRAM. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

Wait, the user's question is in the context of the provided documents, which include multiple models. The answer must be based on the context. The smallest model in terms of parameters is GPT-1 with 117M, requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM. 

But the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. However, the context includes GPT-1, so the answer should be GPT-1. 

But I need to check if there's any mention of a smaller model. For example, the Mistral 7B is 7B parameters, which is larger than GPT-1. So the smallest is GPT-1. 

Thus, the answer is GPT-1 requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM. However, the user's question is about the smallest model, and the context includes GPT-1, which is the smallest. 

But the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. Wait, the user's question is in the context of the provided documents, which include GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral models. The answer must be based on the context. 

Therefore, the smallest model is GPT-1 with 117M parameters, requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM in FP16. However, the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. 

But the context for LLaMA 3.2-1B is mentioned, which is 1B parameters. So the smallest model in the LLaMA context is 1B. 

But the user's question is general. The answer should be based on the entire context. The smallest model in the context is GPT-1 with 117M parameters, requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM. 

But I need to confirm. The context for GPT-1 states: "Wagi mają ~0,5 GB; do uruchomienia w FP16 wystarcza konsumencki GPU." So the VRAM required is ~0.5 GB. 

Thus, the answer is GPT-1 with ~0.5 GB VRAM. 

But the user might be referring to the LLaMA models. However, the context includes GPT-1, so the answer should be GPT-1. 

But the user's question is about the smallest model, which in the context is GPT-1. Therefore, the answer is GPT-1 requiring ~0.5 GB VRAM.

Pytanie 1: Kim jest Sam Altman?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if I'm an AI assistant that can only answer questions using the provided context. The main task is to answer who Sam Altman is, but I need to check the given context first.

Looking through the context information, there are several files mentioning PLLuM, Mistral models, and GPT. The PLLuM documents talk about the Polish language model, its applications, training data, and collaborations. The Mistral AI section mentions various models like Codestral, Mixtral, and their features. The GPT section details different GPT versions and their availability. However, none of these documents mention Sam Altman. 

Sam Altman is a well-known figure in the tech industry, particularly for his role at OpenAI and his involvement with startups like SamAltman.com. But since the context provided doesn't include any information about him, I can't reference any external knowledge. The user emphasized using only the given context, so I need to check again to be sure. 

No mention of Sam Altman is found in any of the provided files. The documents discuss models, their parameters, use cases, and licensing, but not any individuals. Therefore, the correct response is to state that the answer isn't in the provided context.

Pytanie 2: Jakie modele LLaMa są dostępne?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which LLaMA models are available, and they want the answer strictly based on the provided context. First, I need to scan through the context information given.

Looking at the files, there's a document titled "llama.txt" under the header "Rodzina modeli LLaMA – przegląd i wymagania sprzętowe (stan na sierpień 2025 r.)". In that document, there's a section about LLaMA 3.2 released in September 2024. It mentions the addition of lightweight models 1B and 3B, and multimodal variants like Llama 3.2-Vision 11B and 90B. The context also specifies the VRAM requirements for these models, like 6.5GB for 3B in bf16/fp16. 

Additionally, the same document refers to previous generations, LLaMA 3.1, and mentions that LLaMA 3.2 is under the same license as 3.1 with some EU restrictions on the Vision variants. The user's question is about available models, so the key points here are the 1B, 3B, 11B, and 90B variants. 

I need to make sure not to include any models not mentioned in the context. The context doesn't mention other versions beyond 3.2 and 3.1. Also, the user wants specific names and details. The answer should list the models with their sizes and any relevant info from the context, like the VRAM requirements and license notes. 

Wait, the user also mentioned that if the answer isn't in the context, I should say I can't find it. But since the context does have info on LLaMA 3.2 and 3.1, I can proceed. The answer must be fully supported by the context fragments provided. So, I'll list the models mentioned: 1B, 3B, 11B Vision, 90B Vision, and note the license restrictions for EU users on the Vision models. Also, mention the VRAM requirements for each. That should cover the available models based on the given context.

In the "Tło i motywacja" (Background and Motivation) section, there's a mention that PLLuM was officially presented by the Ministry of Digitization on February 24, 2025. The context also states that it was developed by a consortium of Polish universities and institutes, coordinated by the Wrocław University of Technology and supported by NASK PIB, the Institute of Fundamentals of Informatics PAN, the PIB Information Processing Center, the Łódź University, and the PAN Slavistics Institute. 

Another part in the "Podsumowanie" (Summary) section reinforces that the model was co-created by OPiP IB and is part of the #AIMadeInPoland ecosystem. The "Zalety i wyróżniki" (Advantages and Distinctiveness) section also mentions the Polish language model developed by OPiP IB. 

Putting this together, the creators are the consortium of institutions listed, coordinated by Wrocław University of Technology. The answer should include all these entities as per the context.

Pytanie 4: Jaki model najlepiej działa na GPU z 24 GB VRAM?
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking which model works best on a GPU with 24 GB VRAM. They want the answer strictly based on the provided context, no prior knowledge.

First, I need to go through the context documents to find information about VRAM requirements for different models. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the PLLuM.txt, there's mention of the 70B model needing over 90GB VRAM in fp16, which is way above 24GB. The 12B and 8B models are more consumer-friendly, but the exact VRAM numbers aren't specified here. 

Next, the Mistral models in mistal.txt. The Mistral 7B can run on 12GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization. The Mistral Large 2 requires 233GB VRAM in full precision but can be reduced to ~58GB with int4. However, 24GB is still less than 58GB. Wait, the Mistral Large 2.1 version might have different requirements? The context mentions that Mistral Large 2.1 uses int4 quantization, reducing VRAM needs. But the exact number isn't given here. 

Then there's the LLaMA section in llama.txt. The 7B model needs 12-13GB in FP16, and 10GB with quantization. The 13B model needs ~24GB in full precision. Wait, the user's GPU has 24GB VRAM. The 13B model in full precision would require 24GB, which is exactly the VRAM available. But the context says the 13B model in full precision needs ~24GB. However, the user's GPU is 24GB, which might be tight. Also, the Mistral 7B can run on 12GB with 4-bit quantization, so maybe the 13B LLaMA in full precision is a candidate. But the user's question is about the best model for 24GB. 

Wait, the Mistral Large 2.1 version with int4 quantization requires around 58GB VRAM? Wait, no, the context says Mistral Large 2 requires 233GB in full precision, but with int4 quantization, it's ~58GB. Wait, 58GB is still more than 24GB. So that's not suitable. 

Looking again, the Mistral 7B can run on 12GB with 4-bit quantization. The user has 24GB, which is double that. So maybe the Mistral 7B with quantization is feasible. But the user is asking for the best model. 

Wait, the LLaMA 3.1 8B model is mentioned in the PLLuM context as being more consumer-friendly. The LLaMA 3.1 8B would need around 10GB with quantization, which is well within 24GB. But is there any mention of LLaMA 3.1 8B's VRAM requirements? The LLaMA 1 section mentions 7B needing 12-13GB in FP16, but the 8B version might be similar. 

Also, the Mistral Large 2.1's VRAM requirements aren't specified, but the Mistral Large 2 requires 233GB in full precision, which is way over 24GB. 

Wait, the user's GPU is 24GB VRAM. The LLaMA 13B in full precision needs ~24GB, which is exactly the available VRAM. But would that be feasible? Maybe, but it's a tight fit. Alternatively, the Mistral 7B with quantization can run on 12GB, so there's 12GB left. But the user is asking for the best model. 

Another point: the Mistral Large 2.1 version might have better performance but requires more VRAM. The LLaMA 13B in full precision is exactly 24GB. However, the context says that the LLaMA 13B in full precision requires ~24GB. So that's a possible candidate. 

Wait, the user's question is about the best model for 24GB. The LLaMA 13B in full precision would use exactly 24GB, which is possible, but might not have enough margin. Alternatively, the Mistral 7B with quantization uses 12GB, leaving 12GB, which is more than enough. But the Mistral 7B is a smaller model. 

The Mistral Large 2.1's VRAM isn't specified, but the Mistral Large 2 requires 233GB in full precision. So that's not feasible. 

The PLLuM 12B model mentions that the 12B can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, but the exact VRAM isn't specified. However, the 70B requires over 90GB, which is way above 24GB. 

So, considering all the models, the LLaMA 13B in full precision would require 24GB VRAM. However, the context says that the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs ~24GB. That's the closest match. But is there any mention of the LLaMA 13B being suitable for 24GB? The context says the 13B in full precision needs ~24GB, which is exactly the user's GPU. 

Alternatively, the Mistral 7B with quantization can run on 12GB, but that's a smaller model. However, the user might want the best performance. 

Wait, the LLaMA 13B in full precision would need 24GB, which is exactly the VRAM available. So that's the best fit. But the context says that the 13B model in full precision requires ~24GB. Therefore, the LLaMA 13B would be the best model for 24GB VRAM. 

But wait, the user's GPU is 24GB VRAM. The LLaMA 13B in full precision is exactly 24GB. That's the best fit. However, the Mistral 7B with quantization uses 12GB, which is more than enough. But the Mistral 7B is a smaller model. 

The answer should be the LLaMA 13B in full precision, as it's the model that requires exactly 24GB VRAM. However, the context mentions that the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs ~24GB. So that's the best fit. 

Alternatively, the Mistral 7B can run on 12GB with quantization, but the user might prefer a larger model. The LLaMA 13B is a larger model, which might offer better performance. 

Therefore, the answer is the LLaMA 13B model, which requires ~24GB VRAM. The context mentions that the LLaMA 13B in full precision needs ~24GB VRAM. That's the best fit for a 24GB GPU.

Pytanie 5: Ile pamięci potrzeba, aby odpalić najmniejszy model llm? Podaj ilość VRAM i podaj jego nazwę
Odpowiedź: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the amount of VRAM needed to run the smallest LLM model mentioned in the provided context, along with the model's name.

First, I need to scan through the context documents to find any mentions of LLM models and their VRAM requirements. The context includes several files, like pllum.txt, mistal.txt, and llama.txt. Let me check each relevant section.

Looking at the "llama.txt" file, there's a section about LLaMA 1 and LLaMA 2. Under LLaMA 1, it mentions that the 7B variant in FP16 requires around 12-13 GB VRAM. However, there's also a note about quantized versions (like 8-bit or 4-bit) that can run on GPUs with 6 GB VRAM. But the user is asking for the smallest model, so the 7B variant is the smallest in the LLaMA series mentioned here.

Then, in the "mistal.txt" file, there's a section about Ministral 3B and 8B models. The 3B model is mentioned as requiring a minimum of 8 GB VRAM. That's smaller than the 7B LLaMA model's quantized version. However, the user specified "llm" in general, not necessarily tied to a specific series. But the question is about the smallest model, so the 3B Ministral might be the answer.

Wait, but the user mentioned "llm" without specifying a series. The context also includes PLLuM models. Checking the PLLuM section, the smallest model is the 8B variant, but the 3B Ministral from Mistral is smaller. However, the user might be referring to LLaMA models. Wait, the question says "llm" in general, so the smallest model would be the 3B Ministral. But I need to confirm if the context mentions any smaller models.

In the "mistal.txt" section under "Ministral 3B i 8B", it states that the 3B model requires a minimum of 8 GB VRAM. That's the smallest mentioned in the context. The LLaMA 1 7B model's quantized version needs 6 GB VRAM, but the 3B model from Mistral is smaller. However, the user's question is about "llm" in general, so the answer should be the 3B Ministral model requiring 8 GB VRAM. But wait, the LLaMA 1 7B in quantized form needs 6 GB, which is smaller than 8 GB. But the user might be referring to the smallest model in the context. Let me check again.

Wait, the LLaMA 1 7B model in quantized form (like 4-bit) requires 6 GB VRAM. The Ministral 3B requires 8 GB. So the 7B LLaMA in quantized form is smaller. But the user's question is about the "smallest model llm". The context mentions the 3B model as the smallest in the Mistral series, but the LLaMA 1 7B in quantized form is smaller. However, the user might be referring to the smallest model in the LLaMA family. Wait, the question is not specific to a series. The context has multiple models. The smallest model mentioned is the 3B Ministral, but the LLaMA 1 7B in quantized form is 7B but with lower VRAM. Wait, no, the 7B model is larger than the 3B model. So the 3B model is smaller. Therefore, the answer should be the Ministral 3B model requiring 8 GB VRAM. But I need to check if there's any other model smaller than 3B in the context. The context doesn't mention any models smaller than 3B. So the answer is the 3B model, which requires 8 GB VRAM. However, in the LLaMA section, the 7B model's quantized version needs 6 GB VRAM. But the 3B model is smaller in parameters. So the smallest model in terms of parameters is the 3B, but the VRAM required is 8 GB. However, the user is asking for the smallest model, which could be based on parameters or VRAM. The question says "najmniejszy model llm" which translates to "smallest LLM model". The smallest in terms of parameters is the 3B model. Therefore, the answer is the Ministral 3B model requiring 8 GB VRAM. But I need to confirm if there's any other model mentioned with smaller parameters. The context also mentions the LLaMA 1 7B, which is larger than 3B. So the 3B model is the smallest. Hence, the answer is 8 GB VRAM for the Ministral 3B model.
</think>

Odpowiedź: Najmniejszy model LLM wymagający najmniej VRAM to **Ministral 3B**, który potrzebuje **8 GB VRAM**.  

**Podstawa:**  
- W pliku `mistal.txt` podano, że model *Ministral 3B* wymaga minimalnych **8 GB VRAM** (https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux#:~:text=Ministral%208B%20ministral,Mistral%20Commercial%20License).  
- W pliku `llama.txt` zaznaczono, że wersja kwantyzowana modelu LLaMA 7B (np. 4-bitowa) działa na **6 GB VRAM**, ale model ten ma więcej parametrów (7B) niż Ministral 3B (3B), więc nie jest on najmniejszym w kontekście.
